story be accurate, the original composition of the Novum Organum
would be carried back to the year 1608. But the substance of the
First Book is to be found in a work composed ata still earlier period,
the Cogitata et Visa (E. and S., vol. iii. pp. 587-620). This work,
though not published till long after Bacon's death (by Gruter in
1653), must have been composed as early as the summer or autumn
of 1607, as, in that and the early part of the following year, it is the
subject of a correspondente between Bacon and Sir Thomas Bodley
(Spedding's Life and Letters 61 Bacon, vol. iii. pp. 365, 366)⁸⁸. Still
earlier, but standing in much less close relation with the First Book
61 the Novum Organum, as it now exists, is the Partis Secundae
Delineatio (B and S, vol iii. pp. 541-585), which Mr. Spedding
refers to the year 1606 or 1607. For an account 61 this, however,
and other preliminary drafts 61 portions of the Novum Organum, the
student must be referred back to ξ 3 61 this Introduction

The so-called Second Edition of the Novum Organunt is a small
duodecimo, published at Amsterdam in 1660, but, between this and
the First Edition, there were copies published at Leyden in 1645 and
1650 ⁶⁴. Except in editions of the Complete Works or the philoso-
phieal works of Bacon, I cannot find any Latin Edition of the Novum
Organum between the year 1660 and the Wiirzburg Edition of 1780⁶⁸.
One appeared at Glasgow in 1803, and another was issued by the
Clarendon Press in 1813. Since that time, Mr. Kitchin’s and other
annotated Editions, to be mentioned below, have made the work, in
its separate form, easily procurable.

‘¹ Avery beautiful manuscript 0f this work, corrected in Bacon’s own hand·
writing (a fact which is not only vouched for by Mr. Spedding, but which I have
verified by comparison with a letter in the Bodleian written by Bacon 16 the King,
April 21, 1611), exists in Queen's College Library, Oxford.

⁸⁶ Bonillet speaks of an Edition. published at Leyden in 1651. lcan find no
other trace 61 this Edition, and think 11111 he must have mistaken for an edition
of the Novum Organnrn one of the De Augmentis published at Leyden in that year.
His bibliographical account, generally, is not very accurate. Thus, the Ed. 61 1656
(which, like that 61 1615, was published by Adr. Wingnerde) is called an Elzevir.

Iu 1658, a little 12¹²· volume was issued at Leyden, entitled Francisci de Veru-
lamio Historia Naturalis et Experimentalis De Ventis, 816, containing. in addition
16 1116 Historia Ventorum and other matter, Nov. Org. ii. 11-16 (·1)6 Forma
Calidi ’), ii. 48 (‘De Motus sive Virtut‘m Actis-ae Variis Speciebus ⁹). and the In·
stantis Crucis on the Tides from ii. 56. ln the British moseum. there are reprints
61 this volume in 1648 and 1661. 11 was translated by R. G. Gent, London, 1653.

⁸⁸ Watt (Bibliotheca Britannica) speaks 61 an edition in folio, published at
Loadon in 1677· bnt, as 1 can find no other trace 61 this edition, 1 suppose he must
refer 16 the Epitome by 11. D. in English, to be noticetl preseatly.
