qu'atn reliquae. Materia potius considerari debet, et ejus
schematismi‚ et meta-schematismi, atque actus purus ⁸⁶, et lex
actus sive motus; formae enim commenta animi humani
sunt ⁸⁷, nisi libeat leges illas actus formas appellare.

⁸⁶ This expression is the scholastic equivalent lor tbe Aristotelian term
ἐνέργεια or ἐντελέχεια as opposed to δύναμιν, and, as such, may either mean
actual, as opposed to possible motion, growth, or development, or actual, as
opposed to possible existence. For a δύναμιν may either be a possibility ol
motion (taking that word in its wide, Aristotelian sense), or a possibility oi
existence. tf it be a possibility of existence, the existence itseli, when
realised, is called an ἐνέργεια or ἐντελέχεια. But, if it be a possibility oi
motion, we have two cases, according as the motion or process is (ι) an end
in itself, or (τ) results in something beyond itself, an ἔργον τι. Now, in the
first cnse, as, for instance, in walking ior the sake of exercise, the actual as
opposed to the possible motion may be indifferently called axivryors, an
ἐνέργεια, and, though hardly with equal propriety, an ἐντελέχεια. ln the
second case, suppose we take house-building as our instance, we have
(α) the mere δύναμιν or possibility oi house-building, (β) the process itself,
οἰκοδομική, (γ) the result, τὸ ἔργον, the house. Here, οἰκοδομική, the pro·
cess, ought strictly speaking to be called a κίνησιν, but it is also called,
though with less propriety, au ἐνέργεια or even an ἐντελέχειας but the end
or result, the house itsels, can only be said to exist ἐνεργείᾳ οτ ἐντελεχείᾳ,
and the latter expression seems the more appropriate os the two. The
terms ἐνέργεια and ἐντελέχεια are often used interchangeably λγ Aristode,
but, strictly speaking, it would seem that ἐνέργεια (ἐν ἔργῳ) should be
appropriated to a motion which is an end in itseli, while ἐντελέχεια (ἐν
τέλει ἐχειν) ought to be appropriated to the result oi a motion or process,
or to actual as opposed to possible existence. ·

Οτι this distinction, the student is specially recommended to read Tren·
delenburg'sfirst note to De Anima, bk. ii. ch. 1, and to compare the passages
in Aristotle’s works, where the terms ἐνέργεια and ἐντελέχεια occur. He
should notice particularly Metaph. viii. 6 and Eth.vii.14(8). Sir Alex·
ander Grant treats os this distinction at some length iu one of the Essays
appended to his edition ol Aristotle's Ethics.

‘Actus Purus,' in the present passage, may mean either the process of
development by which one material substance passas into another or the
final result which follows from the meta-schematismus, that is to say, the
change in its structure. Thus, theactus purus might either be the process
by which the acom passes into the oak or iron into rust, or it might be the
oak or the rust itself. Conformably to these altematives, ‘lex actrrs sive
motus* may denote either the law governing the process by which the
linal result is attained, or the law expressing the conditions os the result
itself, that is to say, it may denote either a dynamical law or a statical
law. l am inclined to think that, in this place, it has the former meaning.
