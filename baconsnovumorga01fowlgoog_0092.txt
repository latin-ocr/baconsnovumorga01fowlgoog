deficient in this respect, and especially in the confirmation of his
a priori arguments by an inductive examination of facta, yet surely
this is not an exhaustive account os the causes which contributed to
render so large a proportion of his physical researches futile.

To me it appears that many circumstances combined to mar his
efforts in this department of philosophy. Without attempting a
complete enumeration, and, without pretending that those here given
are always mutually exclusive, I may specify the following:

(ι) His observations‚ though very numerous and often very care·
fully conducted, were not infrequently inaccurate or insufficient. Ι
may refer for instances to the numerous cases adduced by Mr. Lewes
in his Aristotle (see, especially, pp. 272, 3, and p. 332), and by the
author of an exceedingly interesting Article on the Historia Animalium
in the Quarterly Review, No. a 33, which, while it does full justice to
Aristode, also freely points out his demerits. See also my Inductive
Locis ard Ed.. vv· 2⁷⁶. r·

(a) Though it cannot be said with truth that Aristotle never tried
experiments, still it must be confessed that he did so very rarely.
The following interesting examples (interesting mainly because they.
are so rare) are given by Mr. Lewes. ‘He refers to the experiment of
tying or'removing the right testis of the male, previous to congress
in disproof of the hypothesis that the sexes are derived from the right
and left testes. He refers to the experiment of removing the eyes
from young birds, to show that these organs are capable of being
reproduced, a capability not observed in adult birds. Although he
places the seat of motive power in the heart, yet he refers to the
experiment of removing the heart from tortoiseS, alter which they
still continue for some time to move 3 and to prove that the nutritive
soul is contained in the centre‚ he refers to the insects whose heads
and limbs may be removed without destroying their vitality.' Mr.
Lewes adds with regard to the last experiment: ‘The fact is incor-
rectly stated. The separated head will live almost as longas the
body; and I have often found the hinder part of a triton live and
move for hours aller its separation from the body! See Lewes'
Aristode, pp. rra, 3. Ι do not recollect any experimenta proposed
by Aristotle in any branch of natural science other than physiology.

(3) He frequently adopted traditional beliefs or stories, some even
which appear to us to be of a ridiculous character, without any further
investigation. To say nothing of the doctrine of the Elementa the
popular notions about gravity and levity, and the like, I may instance
from his physiological works the curious statements about the lion, as,
