sive Similitudines Physicar‚ appellare consuevimus. Eae
vero sunt, quae ostendunt similitudines et conjugationes
rerum, nonin formis minoribus (quod iaciunt instantiae con-
stitutivae) sed plane in concreto ⁷⁸. Itaque sunt tanquam
primi et infimi gradus ad unionem naturae. Neque constituunt
aliquod axioma statim ab initio, sed indicant et observant
tantum quendam consensum corporum ⁷⁹. Attamen licet non
multum promoveant ad inveniendas formas, nihilominus magna
cum utilitate revelant partium universi fabricam, et in membris
ejus exercent veluti anatomiam quandam; atque proinde

by the action of subterraneous lire. There are, however, amid their
similarity, some very remarkable differences in the substances which they
contain, the trap rocks containing calcareous spar, and the lava never
containing any. On the supposition that they are both of igneous origin,
is there any circumstance, in the conditions in which heat may have been
applied to them, which can account ior this differencei Sir james Hali,
in a train of most philosophical and happily-contrived experimenta, has
explained the nature of those conditione, and has shown that the presence
oi calcareous spar, or the wantos it, may arise from the greater or less
compression under which the fusion of the basalt was performed. This
has served to explain a great difficulty in the history of the mineral
kingdom.

‘Comparative anatomy is full of analogies oi this kind, which are most
instructive, and useful guides to discovery. lt was by remarking in the
blood-vessels, a contrivance similar to the valves used in hydraulic anginas,
ior preventing the comiter-current of a fluid, that Harvey was led to the
discovery of the circulation ol the blood. The analogias between natural
and artificial productioris are always highly deserving oi notice.¹ Pre-
liminary Dissertation.

It is by the bold use oi analogies of this kind that modern physicists
have been able to trace the correlations of the various physical forces3
that modern philologists have been able to refer to the same families,
languages of apparently the most dissimilar character; and that modern
jurists and moralists have detected in laws, institutions‚ customs, and
feelings amongst the most widely scattered races and at the most various
stages oi civilisation a common origin anda common meaning. Though
the strici use of logical methodis indispensable to demonstration and
verification, it is the observation oi analogies, and those osten very re·
mote ones, that generally sets us on the track oi great discoveries.

²⁸ That is, they are concerned with individual observations, and not
with inductive generalisations, as arethe lnstantiae constitutivae.

⁷⁹ They serve to suggest axioms, rather than to establish them. See
note 77. lt is curious that consideratione oi this kind did not lead Bacon
to attach greater importanee to the office of the Imagination in scientific
discovery.
