Quin longe validiores sunt ad subeundum assensum antici-
patrbneS, quam interpretatrbms; quia ex paucis collectae,
iisque maxime quae familiariter occurrunt, intellectum statim
perstringunt, et phantasiam implent, ubi contra, interpreta-
tiones, ex rebus admodum variis et multum distantibus spar-
sim collectae, intellectum subito percutere non possunt3 ut
necesse sit eas, quoad opinionesii, duras et absonas, fere instar
mysteriorum fidei videri.

faculties. We cannot transcend human consciousness. We cannot do
more than observe phenomena and reflect on the observations made. All
that we know, we can know only through the medium of our own senses
and our own intellect, and hence all knowledge must tentative to our
own cognitive powers. All that we can say, ln the last resort,is thata
proposition is true to ns. As to what may be true or false to other orders
of beings, differently constituted, we can have no conception, except so far
as we have grounds for supposing that their intelligences and the conditions
under which their intelligences work are analogous to our own. As to
‘absolute truth,' or ‘truth in itself,' the phrase seems to be entirely devoid
of meaning, the very word ‘truth’ implying a percipient or thinking
subject as wellas an object of perception or thought. Thus, it is quite
conceivable that belngs with different faculties, or brought up amidst a
different set of conditions, might, if they could observe us, suppose us
to be all mad after the same fashion, as we, similarly, should suppose
them to be.

As regards the second consideration, namely, the possibility of universal
error, an important distinction must be drawn. Our Immediate perceptions
(when corrected by comparison with each other and with those of other
rnen) are our ultimate test of tnrth3 if these deceive us, we bave no
other criterlon to gulde us. But our iry'erences from these perceptions
not only may be, but frequently are, false, and it has sometimes happened,
as in the'belief that the earth was the centre of the solar system, that
all mankind have through several generations been mistaken ln the ln·
ferences they drew from observed facts. In such cases, the false inlerence
bas often, in tbe first instance, been drawn by oue or a few persons, and
tbe rest have accepted it Implicitly on their authority. Errors of this
kind, however long or unirersally they may have obtained, need not lead
us to despair as to the possibility of attaining truth. Previous errors
ln reasoning have been detected by the employment of the reasoning
process itself, and hence we may fairly suppose that, if there are any
questions now on which all men are mistaken, posterity will be able to
correct our false infercnces, as we have corrected those of our ancestors.
The source of our errors itself supplies us with the means of correcting
thern.
