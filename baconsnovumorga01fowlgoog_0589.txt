E. and S., vol. iii. p. 157. Mr. Ellis refers to Marco Polo, ii. 77. ln l
Marsden’s Translation of Marco Polo (London, 1818), the passage runs as r

follows: ‘They collect a certain kind of earth, as it were from a mine,
and, laying it in a great heap, suffer it to be exposed to the wind, the rain,
and the sun, for thirty or forty years, during which time it is never dis·
turbed. By this it becomes refined and fit for being wrought into the
vessels above mentioned. Such colours as may he thought proper are
then laid on, and the ware is afterwards balred ln ovens or rumam

One of the numerous derivations of porcelain is the odd one ‘pour cent
annees3’ ‘because it was believed by Europeans‚ that the materiale of

(Pickering’s Ed, vol. ii. pp. 352-4). Several authorities are there cited
both for and against this ‘common belief!

ln Col. Yule's Edition of Marco Polo, the passage given above is re·
jected as an interpolation of Ramusio. Commenting on lt, Col. Yule says:
‘This story of the life-long period during which the porcelain clay was
