INTRODUCTION. 87

carelessness. (On this and other points connected with Aristotle's
method, cp. ξ 11 of this Introduction). Some of his remarks on the
proper examination of facts or theories are characterised by great
sagacity. Take, for instance, the passage in Eth. vii. 1 (5): Δεῖ δ’,
ὥσπερ ε’πὶ τῶν ἄλλων, τιθέντας τὰ φαινόμενα, troi πρῶτον διαπορήσαντας, cahra
δεικνύναι μάλιστα μὲν πάντα τὰ ἔνδοξα περὶ τοῦτο τὰ πάθη, εἰ δι’ με), τδ πλεῖστα
καὶ κυριώτατα· ε’δν γδρ λῦηταῖ τε τδ δυσχερῆ καὶ καταλείπηται τὰ ἔνδοξα,
δεδειγμένου dv εἴη lxavw‘. In his treatises generally, but especially
in the Politics and the Historia Animalium, we find extensive collec-
tions of facts ; nor, as 1 have shewn elsewhere ⁹⁷, did he altogether
neglect experiment. That he was impatient, and even jealous. of the
authority of others ⁹⁸, has generally been brought as a charge against
him, and, about the tirne of the Revival of ,Letters was frequently
adduced as an argumentum ad hominem by those who were anxious to
throw off the bonds of his own authority.

As the works of Aristotle, and specially his logical works, were
constantly being reproduced and commented on during the bliddle

Ages, it would bc easy, though superfluous, to accumulate from medi-
aeval writers passages on the origin of knowledge in the perceptions of

the senses (as being, at least, its conditionis not its source), and on '
the relation of induction to deduction. It will be sufficient, as a
specimen, to quote the following passages from the Metalogicus of
John of Salisbury (tib. iv. capp. 8, 9), written about 1160: ‘Et sic
demonstrandi scientiam statuit, ac si sensu corporeo teneatur, quae
ratio indubitata sic esse convincit. Communes enirn conceptionesa
singulorum inductione fidem sortiuntur. Impossibile enim est un·
versalia speculari, non per inductionem; quoniam, ut ait, quae ex
abstractione dicuntur, per inductiones, ignota, nota fiunt. Inducere

having regard to oausal connection in framing our generalisations. Tm chapter
is also interesting as affording examples of the 'negative instances' to which
Bacon attaches so much importanoe. At the same time, ir is remarkable for the
carelessness of observation which it displays.

My friend Mr. J. A. Stewart of Christ Church has drawn my attention to a re-
markable correspondence between some of the loci in Topics, ii. ro, 11, and the
canons of reasoning in modern Inductive Logic. The passage is worth more
attention than it has received

It may herc bc noticed that Aristotle also recogniscs an imperfect form of in-
duction, answering to the Analogy of Mr. Mill and recent logicians. This is the
παράδειγμα οι ἐπαγωγὴ ῥητορική. See An. Pr. ii. 24.

⁹⁸ The case of Reason versus Authority has never been better or more tersely put
than by Aristonem. Nic. i. 6 (1): ἀμφοῖν γὰρ ὄντοιν φίλοιν, ὅσιον προτιμᾶν τὴν
ἀλήθειαν. Hence the proverb: ‘Amicus Plato; magis amica veritas'
