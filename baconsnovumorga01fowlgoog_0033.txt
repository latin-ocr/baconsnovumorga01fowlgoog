present instalment: ‘Primitiae Historiae nostrae Naturalis Celsitudini
tuae humillime offero. Rem mole perpusillam, veluti Granum Sinapis:
sed tamen pignus eorum, quae Deo volente sequentur. Obstrinximus
enim nos ipsos tanquam voto, singulis nos mensibus, ad quos Dei
bonitas (cujus agitur Gloria tanquam in cantico novo) vitam nostram
produxerit, unam, aut plures ejus partes, prout suerint magis aut
minus arduae, aut copiosae, confecturos, et edituros. Moti etiarn
sortasse erunt alii, nostro exemplo, ad similem industriam: praesertim
postquam penitus perspexerint, quid agatur. Nam in Historia Natu·
rali bona, et bene instituta, clavis suntet Scientiarum et Operum!
This volume contains only general prefatory remarks, the Historia
Ventorum, and an Aditus to each of the following proposed treatises:
Historia Densi et'Rari; Historia Gravis et Levis; Historia Sym· ¹
pathiae et Antipathiae Rerum; Historia Sulphuris‚ Mercurii, et Salis;
and Historia Vitae et Mortis. These five ‘Historiae’ were to follow
the Historia Ventorum at intervals of a montis It appears that the
volume containing the Historia Ventorum was published about the
beginning of November, 1622 ; the Historia Vitae et Mortis about
the ¹end of the following January, 1622-312. The reason for bringing
out the latter book before the four intermediate ones is stated to he
‘propter eximiam rei utilitatem ; in qua vel minima temporis jactura
pro pretiosa haberi debet’ The Historia Densi et Rari did not
appear till the publication of Dn Rawiey's Opuscula Varia i’osthuma
in 1658. It goes over a good deal of the same ground as a tract,
entitled Phaenomena Universa, published by Gruter in 1653 ¹³. The
remaining three subjects Bacon does not appear to have handled, at
least in separate treatises.

The Sylva Sylvarum, which is a miscellaneous collection of obaer-
vatiorrs and experiments, taken mainly from books, was not published
till after Bacon's death. It was edited by Rawley in 1627, Bacon
having died in 1626. interesting in many respects as this collection
is, it is the least creditable of Baeon's philosophical works, and has
furnislred Liebig and other antagonists with many of their most
effective weapons In fact, as Bacon is reported by Rawley to have
said himself, ‘if he should have served the glory of his own Name, he
had been better not to have published this Natural History.’ ln my
