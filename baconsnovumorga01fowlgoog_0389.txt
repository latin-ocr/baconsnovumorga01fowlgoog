bright‚ and the slry above the horizon, from the reflected glare of these
livid flames, was not so utterly obscure as over the vault oi the heavens.
‘As we proceed further southward the sea is seldom phosphorescent;
and off Cape Homl do not recollect more than once having seen it so,
and theu it was far from being brilliant. This circumstance probably has a
close connexion with the scarcity os organic beings in that part of the ocean.

After the elaborate paperby Ehrenberg, on the phosphoreseence of the sea, ’

it is almost superfluous on my part to make any observatione on the subject.
1 may however add, that the same torn and irregular particles of gelatinous
matter, described by Ehrenberg, seem in the southern as wellas iu the
northern hemisphere, to be the common cause of this phenomenon. * * *
‘Observing that the water charged with gelatinous particles is in au
impure state, and that the luminous appearance in all common cases is
produced by the agitation of the liuid in coutact with the atmosphere,
1 am inclined to consider that the phosphoreseence is the result of the
decomposition of the organic particles, by which process (one is tempted
almost to call it a kind of respiration) the ocean becomes purified!
Whether this conjecture be true or not, there can be uo doubt that the
phosphoreseence of the sea is often due to living organisms
¹ Mr. Ellis remarks that this is ‘merely a translation of πνεύμων θαλάσ-

nous appearance arises apparently from serpent medusae, which in texture
are like the substance of the lunge, from which circumstance they derive
the name which Dioscorides gives them!
