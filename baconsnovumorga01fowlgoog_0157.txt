passage of his, Incredibile est quantum agmen Idolorum Philosophiae
immiserit, Naturalium Operationum ad Similitudinem Actionum
Humanarum Reductio. But if that of his be extended further, to
take away all Final Causes from the things of Nature, as if nothing
were done therein for Ends Intended bya Higher Mind, then it is
the very Spirit of Atheism and lnhdelity! For the whole discussion,
see First Edition‚ pp. 679—683, or the Latin Translation of 1733,
vol. ii. pp. 820-825 (cap. 5. §5 61, 62). Mosheim, who points out
that the allusion is to Baeon, attempts, in his note, to explain ‘quare
Cudworthius toties eximium huncce virum castiget, qui magnam
ubique in scriptis suis supremi Numinis reverentiam et studium
testatur⁴⁸.' There can be little doubt that, in his frequent attacks
on the philosophy of Democritus, Cudworth also glauces at Bacora
Remusat dravo attention to the circumstance that Cudworth did not
combat Bacon by name. ‘Par equite ou par respect, il n'en veut
pas faire un adversaire de la verite. Ainsi que Boyle dans sa defense
des causes finales, Cudworth ne nomme point Bacon en soutenant
les memes principes que Boyle, et l'usage s'est etabli presque sans
exception de ne pas comprendre Bacon dans les attaques dirigees
contre sa doctrine. Compromettre cenom dans la controverse serait
encore aujourd'hui une sorte d’inconvenance.’ Remusat’s Ba'con,
P· 409·

One of the most violent antagonists of Bacon and of the Royal
Society (names which, in his mind, were evidently very closely con·
nected) was Dr. Henry Stubbe3 ‘the most noted person of his age
that these late times have produced,' says Antony Wood, who has
devoted to him one of the quaintest and most amusing of his Lives ⁴⁹.
Stubbe was a turn-coat alike in philosophy, religion, and politice, and
was animated by more even than the usual bitterness of his class.
His diatribes against Sprat, Glanvil, the Royal Society in general,
and Bacon as their philosophieal father, are, however virulent, too
dull and rambling to be worth transcription, but specimens of thern
may be found in the Legends no Histories (1670), in the Plus
Ultra reduced to a Non Plus (1670), The Lord Bacon’s Relation
of the Sweating·Sickness (1671), and An Epistolary Discourse
concerning Phlebototny (1671). He speaks repeatedly of ‘these

ton, vol. ii. pp. 337-339) has some severe remarks on Cudworth, who, he thinks, is
