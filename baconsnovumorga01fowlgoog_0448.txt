Similiter, exempli gratia; sit natura inquisita Communicatio
Qualitatis absque Commistione Substantiae. Instantia Lucis
dabit vel constituet unam speciem communicationis3 Calor
vero et Magnes alteram. Communicatio enim lucis est
tanquam momentanea, et statim perit, amota luce originali.
At calidum et virtus magnetica, postquam tramissa suerint
vel potius excitata in alio corpore, haerent et manent ad
tempus non parvum, amoto primo movente.

Denique magna est omnino praerogativa instantiarum con·
stitutivarum, ut quae plurimum faciant et ad definitiones
(praesertim particulares) et ad divisiones sive partitiones
naturarum3 de quo non male dixit Plato, Quod habendus sit
tanquam pro Deo, qui definire et dividere bene sciat ⁷⁶.

π Mr. Kitchin quotes Phaedrus, 266 Α (it should be 266 B): Τοίπων
δὴ ἔγωγε αὐτόν τε ἐραστής, ὦ Φαῖδρε, τῶν διαιρέσεων καὶ συναγωγῶν, ἵν’ οἶός τε
ὦ λέγειν τε καὶ φρονεῖν· ε’άν τέ τιν’ ἄλλον ἡγήσωμαι δυνατὸν eis ἓν καὶ ε’πὶ
πολλὰ πεφυκόὸ ὁρᾶν, τοῦτον διώκω κατόπισθε μετ’ ἰ’χνιον ὥστε θεοῖο.

⁷⁷ This very important class of instances consists of ‘ Analogies’ drawn
from objects or qualities in many respects dissimilar—at all times one of
the most fertile sources of suggestion both for scientific discoveries and
practicai inventions. The imaginative and truly philosophicai type of
mind which is adapted to note these resemblances is well described by
Bacon in i. 55.

Professor Playfair, giving examples of these instances, says: ‘Such are
the telescope and microscope, in the works of art, compared with the eye
in the works of nature. This, indeed, is an analogy which goes much
beyond the mere exterior3 it extends to the iuterna} structure, and to the
principle of action, which is the same in the eye and in the telescope,-
to the latent schematism, in the language of Bacon, as far as material
substance is concerned. lt was the experiment of tbe camera obscura
which led to the discovery of the formation oi the images of externat
objects in the bottom of the eye by the action of the crystalline lens, and
the other humours of which the eye is formed.

‘Among the instances of conformity‚ those are the most useful which
enable us to compare productioris of an unknown formation, with similar
productioris of which the formation is well understood. Such are basalt,
and the other trap rocks, compared with the lava thrown out from volca-
noes. They have a structure so exactly similar, that it is hardly possible
to doubt that their origin is the same, and that they are both produced
