⁴⁶ Cp. ii.5 ad finz, ii. 35, ii. 36 (a), and notes. There is little on this
subject to add to what has already been said on the above passages. The
reader will not fail to contrast Bacon’s curious conceptions about morior
(derived from the Peripatetics) with the Laws of Molion, as known to us

⁴⁷ ‘This passage is wholly in accordance with the Peripatetic system ol
physica. But the modifications which Bacon goes on to enumerate, to
which, as he conceives, the eternal circular motions of the heasenly hodie
may be subject, are sufficient to destroy the whole ἃ priori argumentis
favour of such a system of astronomy as that which we find in the tnelr'rl
book of the Metaphysics. lt has not been sufficiently observed that the
Ptolemaic system is no less at variance with the Peripatetic philosophy
than the heliocentrical. The attempta of Turrianus and F racastorius ro
construet what may be called an orthodox system oi astronomy-thath
one in which all the motions should take place in circles of which the earth
is the centra-was suggested chiefly, as we learn from the Homocentrira
of the latter, by the wish to reconcile astronomy and philosophy. lt had
no scientific value, since it left all the phenomena of variations of parallar
and apparent diameter unexplained‚ or, at any rate, gave an explanation ol
them which no astronomer would accept. lt was nevertheless favourably
received by the systematic Peripaticians. See, for instance, F laurinus
De prima Philosoph. Paraph. p. 119. (l quote the Basle edition of rssvl'
ΜΓ. Ellis’ note.
