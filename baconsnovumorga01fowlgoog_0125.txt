102 INTRODUCTION.

Gassendi (who was, in many respectas precursor of Lache, and
whom that philosopher appears to have carefully studied) gives in his
book De Logicae Origine et Varietate, cap. ro, a somewhat elaborate
account of the contenta of the Novum Organum, while, in cap. 11, be
compares it favourably with the Logic of Descartes. ln the book De
Logicae Fine, cap. 6, be recurs to the subject. Itis plain that he sympa-

thises warmly with Bacon's aims and efforts: ‘husu vere Hernico novam
tentare viam est ausus, sperareque fore ut, modo illi strenue diligen·

terque insistatur, nova tandem eaque perfecta condi haberique Philo·
sophia possit.' Descartes is spoken of as imitating Bacon in the
destructive part of his method, and praised accordingly. But, in the
constructive parts, their methods diverged as widely as could be:
‘Non eandem tamen viam est quam Verulamius ingressus; sed curn
Verulamius auxilia a rebus ad perficiendam Intellectus cogitationem
petierit, ipse, omni rerum cogitatione ablegata, censuit in ipsa cogita·
tione satis esse praesidii, ut Intellectus possit vi suain omnium rerum
etiam abstrusissimarum, boc est non modo corpomm sed Dei etiam ac
Animae, notitiam perfectam venire!

‘In another work' (Ι here quote from Mnllfacvey Napier), ‘bis
valuable account of his celebrated friend Peiresc [contained in vol. w.

of Gassendi’s works], there is a passage in which Bacon is mentioned
’ in away particularly deserving of notice in the present discussion.
“No man,'' says Gassendi, speaking of his friend, “made more obser·
vations, or caused more to bc made, to the end, that at last some
notions of natural things, more sound and pure than those commonly
received, might be collected; for which reason he admired the genius»
and approved the design of that great chancellor of England, Sir
Francis Bacon.'' Now, Peiresc died in 1637, only eleven years after
Bacon. But this is not all. He was the first man in France, according
to Bailly, who deserved the name of an astronomer ; and he, as well
as Gassendi (who was also distinguished as an astronomer), wasa
correspondent, friend, and admirer of Galilco: yet we see that Bacon

depuis plusieurs annees’ 'Ibe author then proceeds to contrast the grandeur of his
design with the slendemess of his performnnce, and, like a true disciple, says that
the execution of a design so heroic was reserved for a genius still more extra·
ordinary. Of the actual performauoe in the Novum Organum he speaks dis·
paragingly. ‘Mais ce n’etoit qu'un essay rie ses sublimes projets, capable seule·
ment ds laisser dans l'esprit de ses lecteurs une idee tres-grande de ce qu'il faisoit
esperer i la Posterite. Aussi woyons nous qu'il n'y approfondit rien; que les pro·
positione et les salomes qu'il y avance sont plutdt des avis et des expediens pour
donner des ouvertures b mediter. que des maximes propres h tnbtir des principea'
Bayle. in his mesgre account of Bacon. refers to this work.
