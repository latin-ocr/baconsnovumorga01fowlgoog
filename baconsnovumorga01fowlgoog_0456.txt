LIB. II. 28. 433

sint aequalia, conforme est cum fabrica syllogismi in logica,
qui unit ea quae conveniunt in medio ⁹⁷. Denique multum
utilis est in quamplurimis sagacitas quaedam in conquirendis
et indagandis conformitatibus et similitudinibus physicis,

XXVIII.

Inter praerogativas instantiarum, ponemus septimo loco¹
Instantias Monadicas⁹⁸3 quas etiam Irregulares sive Hatera·
clitas (sumpto vocabulo a grammaticis) appellare consuevi·
mus. Eae sunt, quae ostendunt corpora in concret0, quae
videntur esse extravagantia et quasi abrupta in natura, et
minime convenire cum aliis rebus ejusdem generis, EtenIm
instantiae conformes sunt similes alterius, at instantiae mano-
dicae sunt sui similes. Usus vero instantiarum monadica-
rum est talis qualis est instantiarum clandestinarnm: viz. ad

π ‘Quae in eodem tertio conveniunt, et inter se conveniunt, regula est
itidem ex Mathematicis; verum simul tam potens in Logica, ut syllogismi
sit fundamentum! De Augm. iii. 1. There, and in the corresponding
passage of the Advaucemeut of Learning, several other examples of these
‘Axioms’ are given.

The Mathematical Axiom that ‘things which are equal to the same
thing are equal to one another' is, strictly speakmg, only applicable to
Logic, if we quantity the predIcate. But the dictum de omni et nullo,
the maxim ‘nota notae est nota rei ipsius‚’ and syllogistIc principles
such as the ‘Canon ol Reasoning iu the Ficst Figure’ which l have given
in my DeductIve Logic (eth Ed„ p. 91), are analogous (‘ conformia ¹) to it.
ln the passage in the text, this is all that Bacon’s language implies.

The later examples in ths ApborIsm supply another illustration of
i.1a7. Cp. Aphs. 26, 35.

⁰⁸ Properly ‘monadicas’ See note on i. 45. ln the edition of the
Novum Organum, published at Amsterdam in 1660, ‘monadica’ is read
throughout the Second Book, though, curiously, the correction is not made
in the F irst Book.

Comets, Double Stars, the occasionn crescent-shape of Venus, os Mer·
cury, and of the Moon, Earthquakes, Volcanoes, Cyclones, MeteorIc Stones,
the pecuIIarities in the relation between the expansion and temperature of
water as well as of bismuth and the casting·metals generally, are all good
examples of what Bacon means by these instances. similarly, in law,
we might adduce as ‘monadic iustances’ Gavelkind aud Borough English,
or, iu moral sentiment, Suttee, Duelliug, the Levirate, dcc. lt is some· '
times indifferent whether we refer an example to this head or the next
of Instantiae Deviautes, as is the case with oue or two of the examples
gisen above.
