(5) Similiter, sit natura inquisita Corporea Substantia
Lenaee: an sit tenuis, flammea, sive ae'rea, ut plurimi ex
priscis philosophis opinati sunt; an solida et densa, ut Gil-
bertusl et multi moderni, cum nonnullis ex antiquis, tenent.
Rationes posterioris istius opinionis fundantur in hoc maxime,
quod luna radios solis reflectat3 neque videtur fieri reflexio
lucis nisi a solidis 2.

Itaque instantiae crusis circa hoc subjectum eae esse poterint
(si modo aliquae sint) quae demonstrent reflexionem a corpore
tenui, qualis est flamma, modo sit crassitiei sufficientis ³. Certe

⁹⁹ The nature of the substance of the heavenly bodies generally is cone
sidered in the Descriptio Globi Intellectuaiis, cap. 7, and in the Thema
Coeli.

¹ This must be an allusion to Gilbert's known opinions, not to his
writings. For· the posthumous book De Mundo nostro sublunari, which
contains his speculations on this subject, was not published till1651. lt
may, however, have been read by Bacon in manuscript (see note 82 on
Aph. 48 (8) ). In this work, lib. ii. capp. 13-16, Gilbert passes in review the
various opinions of the ancients, and himself arrives at the following con·
clusion: ‘Luua, diversa natura a Sole, est solida absque lumine substantia,
diversa in eminentiis, non provenit unquam ab inspissatione imaginatae
quintae essentiae, adeo ut densior pars sit sphaerae nugatoriae: sed astrum
est, sicut tellus, suis spatiis motum habens. Tellus vero etiam sicut altera
Luna est, quae etiam a Sole accepto lumine versus Lunam relucet, sicut
Luna conceptum a Sole lumen in tellurem remittit; omne enim solidum
lumen remittit! For Aristotle's fifth element (quintessence), or aether,
which he regarded as having a circular motion, and as extending dvo καὶ
μέχρι σελήνας, see, amongst other places, Meteorologica, i. 3, De Coelo, i. 3,
De Animalium Generatione‚ ii. 3, and the spurious treatise De Mundo,
ch. a. ln the last passage, which represents the doctrines of the Peri·
patetic school, the writer says: adparari δὲ καὶ ἄστρων οὐσίαν ρέν αἰθέρα
καλοῦμεν, . . . στοιχεῖον οὖσαν ἕτερον τῶν τεττάρων, ἀκήρατόν τε καὶ θεῖον. In
the De Animaiium Generatione‚ iii. 11 (p. 761 b. 21, ος), Aristotle speaks of
the moon as composed of fire: ἀλλὰ δεῖτὸ τοιοῦτον γένος (sc. τὸ τοῦ πυρός)
ζητεῖν ε’πὶ τῆς σελήνης· αὕτη γὰρ φαίνεται κοινωνοῦσα τῆς τετάρτης ἀποστάσεως.

² This is certainly not Gilbert’s argument, as it appears in his book.
He argues quite rightly (lib. ii. cap. ¹3) to the opacity and solidity oi the
moon from the fact that, in a Solar Eclipse, it does not transmit any oi the
light oi the Sun: ‘Videmus enim in deliquiis solaribus, tanquam opacissima
mole, Solis lumen sisti et averti! So far from stating that light is reflected
only from solid bodies, he refers, in the course of his discussion, to the very
familiar lact of the reflection of light from water.

⁸ All bodies, which are not absolutely black or absolutely transparent,
reflect light, though, of course, in the most varying degrees. araneis

simply an ignited gas.
