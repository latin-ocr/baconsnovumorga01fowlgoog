work ol posterity‚ Bacon hoped himself to supply ‘initia non con·
temnenda! For any special treatise, however, which can be referred
to this head, we search in vain amongst his works. Nor is this
lact without its explanation. The Scientia Activa was to depend
on the knowledge os ‘Forma' but how lar Bacon was srom having
attained to a knowledge ol* Fonns‚' and how vague was the concep·
tion which he osten attached to this term, will be only too familiar to
the attentive student of the Novum Organum. The story which he
applies to the Alchemists¹⁶ of the old man who bequeathed to his
sons a piece ol gold hidden in a vineyard applies also, in no small
measure, to himself. He did not discover ‘Forma' but he did what
was of sar more value to posterity ; he recalled men to the observation
ol facts, gave an impulse to the study ol nature, and, is not the
lounder ol the Inductive Method, at least contributed more than any
other man to its wider, more correct, and more fruitlul employment.

In one of his articles in the Allgemeine Zeitung (Nov.3,1863),

Liebig asserts roundly that Bacon wrote none of his works in Latin3
that they we're translated by people who knew nothing os the subjects
ol which they treated, and, as Bacon was not very clear upon thern
himself, we may imagine the resultl In another article (March 6,
1864), he is especially angry with Sigwart sor having called in
question this assertion‚ and reiterates dogmatically the statement
that all the Latin works ol Bacon required the intervention ol a
translator. The proof is a letter lrom Bacon to Dr. Playfer of
Cambridge (given in Spedding's Lite and Lenem, vol. iii. pp. 300,
301), requesting him to undertake the translation ol the Advance-
ment of Learning. Liebig argues that, is, at the age ol lortysirt
(he should have said about the age ol sorty-six or lorty-seven ; lor
there is nothing enabling us to fix the exact date ol this letter), and
when he had but few engagements‚ Bacon did not recognise his
aptitude sor translating his first scientific work into Latin, itis hardly
likely that he would possess this aptitude in his sixtieth year, when he
held high office under the Crown, and was immersed in business.
Now, there is nothing whatever in Bacon's letter to Playfer which
either asserts or implies inaptitude to write Latin. And, as to being
