vol. i. pp. 433-437), iii. a, iii. 4, ix. throughout; Essays on Unity
in Religion, Atbeism, and Superstiti0n; and, lastly, Bacon’s formal
Confession of Faith¹⁶. Of this last piece, however, it should be
stated that it first appeared in the Remains (1648), and that, as it is
described in the Harleian MS.¹⁷ as by Mr. Bacon, it must have been
written before the summer of 1603. Thus, it may possibly (though
I have no positive reason for saying that it is so) enter into more
minute details of doctrine than Bacon would afterwards have been
disposed to do. To the Christian Paradoxes I do not refer, as being
now known to have been written by another hand¹⁸.

On carefully considering these and the other passages in which
Bacon alludes to religion, or handles religious subjects, the im-
pression left on my mind may be summed up in the following
conclusions.

ret Notwithstanding his admiration for the philosophy of Demo·
critus, and his rejection of Final Causea from tbe domain of Physics,
be retained an unwavering faith in the existence of the Supreme God,
the creator and fasbioner of the universe. The following well-known
sentences from the Essay on Atheism (published, it must be recol·
lected, in its corrected form by Bacon’s own authority in 1625, the
year before his death) express, I believe, the most sincere convictione
of bis beart: ‘I bad rather believe all tbe fables in the legend, and

tbe Talmud, and the Alcoran, than that this universal frame is without
a mind. And therefore God never wrought miracle to convince

atheism, because his ordinary works convince it. lt is true, thata '

little philosophy inclineth man's mind to atheism a but depth in philo·
sopby bringeth men's minds about to religion. For while the mind
of man loolreth upon second causes scattered, it may sometimes rest
in thern, and go no further; but when it beholdeth the chain of them,
confederate and linked together, it must needs fly to Providence and

Deity. Nay, even that school which is most accused of atheism doth
most demonstrate religion3 that is, tbe school of Leucippus and

‘⁸ Nemely by Herbert Palmer. 'lhepiece is included in the second part of his
Maroneia of Godliness and Christianity. This fact was discovered hythe Rev.
Alexander Grosart. Much doubt had previously attached to the pisce, in conae·
qumoe of its not being included in the collectione of either Rawley or Tenison,
though it appeared in the Remains of 1648. For the carious history of the piece,
and tbe canons conjectures about it, aee Remnset p. 150. note ι, Ε. and S, vol.
vii. p. 289, and, especially, Spedding's letters and Life, vol. vi. pp. 130, 151.
