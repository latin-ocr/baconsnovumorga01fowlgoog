⁹ Ἐπίστασθαι οἰόμεθα ὅταν τήν τ’ αἰτίαν οἰώμεθα γινώσκειν, δι’ ἣν τὸ πρᾶγμά
ἐστιν, ὅτι ἐκείνου αἰτία ἐστι’, καὶ μὴ ἐνδέχεσθαι τοῦτ’ ἄλλως ἔχειν. Arist. An.
Post. l. 2 ad init.

whatever may be our opinion as to the nature of Causation, or the
ultimate analysis of the idea oi Cause, this maxim is undoubtedly true;
we cannot truly know a thing, unless we know its antecedents and con·
ditions.

¹⁰ On the Four Causes of Aristotle, see Introduction, § 8, n. 30.

¹¹ ln the actions of men, we must, of course, take account of Final
Causes. We know by experience that men always or generally act, con·
sciously or unconsciously, with some end in view. Hence, to understand
their acts, we must enquire into their aims. lt is from supposing that
Nature always, in like manner, has some end in view, from an analogy, in
lact, between man and nature, that the theory of Final Causes has been
extended to Physics.

On the subject of Final Causes generally, and Bacon’s criticism of the
doctrine, see introduction, ς ro.

¹² Cp. Bk. i. Aph. 75.

¹⁸ He is probably alluding here to the ὕλη, or shapeless matter, potentially
all things and actually nothing, of the Aristotelians, and to the habit of
referring natural events and processes to God or Nature as the First
Cause, instead of secking to ascertain the second and proximate Efficient
Causes. The proximate efficient cause with Bacon would be the latens
processus, and the proximate material cause the latens schematismus. Α
knowledge of these, he thought, would increase our power over nature,
whereas the various speculatione about the more remote causes apper-
tained, he conceived, not to physics, but to metaphysica and theology.

The causes which he condemns as ‘remote’ and ‘superficiei’ may, how·
ever, simply be the material and efficient causes, as popularly assigned.
Thus, for instance, we might say that vegetable matter was the material
cause oi coal, and continued pressure its efficient cause. But Bacon wouhl
