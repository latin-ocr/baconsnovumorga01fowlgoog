‘This list, for which l am entirely indebted to Mr. Ellis’s prelaces
and notes, might probably be increased; but the instances enumerated
are sufficient to shew not only that Bacon was ill read in the history
ol these branehes os learning, (and yet it was in this direction
that science was making tbe most real and rapid advances,) but
also that upon such subjects his ideas were not clear; this latter
defect being no doubt the cause os the other; sor where he could not

readily follow the steps oi the investigation, he could hardly appreciate
the value oi the result’

To this list, formidable as itis, might ‘be added a number of
beliess in which Bacon was certainly not superior to the current
opinions of his time. Thus, he is evidently a believer, not only in
Natural but Judicial Astrology, though, it must be owned, with a'
certain amount ol hesitation and discrimination. See the long ’
and remarkable passage in De Augmentis, lib. iii. cap. 4 (E and S,
vol. i. pp. 554-560). Alter beginning with the very true remark, ‘At
Astrologia multa superstitione referta est, ut vix aliquid sanum inea
reperiatur,’ and rejecting various branehes of the pretended science,
he, nevertheless, allows that the study ol the stars may enable us to
predict not only natural events, like floods, lrosts, droughts, earth·
quales, &c., but ‘wars seditions, schisms, transmigrations of peoples,
and, in short, all commotioris or great revolutions os things, natural
as well as civil! ‘Neque Electiones prorsus rejiciendae sunt; sed
parcius illis quam Praedictionibus fidendum. Videmus enim in planta·
tionibus et seminationibus et insitionibus, aetatum lunaeobservationes
non esse res omnino frivolas ⁵⁴!

To the curious and absurd speculations on ‘spirit,’ which abound
in the Novum Organum and elsewhere, and many oi which seem to
have been derived irom Paracelsus, l shall ¹frequently have occasion
to call attention in the notes. A typical passage may be found in
Novum Organum, ii. 40.

Though Patricius had already, in the most scomful language,
attached the Peripatetic doctrine oi the transmutability oi the elements,
Bacon evidently believed that air and water, under certain conditions,
were mutually convertible. Thus in the Novum Organum, ii. 48 (rr),

affectus lunae, et passiones corporum inferiorum, prout ex experimentis agriculturae,
nauticae, et medicinae, natalias, cum delectu severo et sincero colligi et recipi
