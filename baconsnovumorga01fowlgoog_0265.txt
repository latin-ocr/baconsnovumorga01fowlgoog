partibus philosophiamm reliquarum, introducendo formas

saepissime medias, et hujusmodi. Huic autern rei summa
adhibenda est cautio. Pessima enirn res est errorum apo-

⁸⁸ Forms abstracted from matter, as opposed to detennined in matter.
Some of the more extreme realists maintained that forms or essences
badan existence independent of and anterior to the individual objects
in which they are manifested. This was the doctrine of ‘universalia
ante rem!

³⁹ Bacon always insiste on referring physical events to physical causes,
and not, as was far more frequently the case in his time than our own, to
the immediate action of God. Cp. Advancement of Learning, bk. i. (E.
and S., vol. iii. p. 267): ‘For certain it is that God worketh nothing in
nature but by second causes; and if they would have it otherwise believed,
it is mere impostura, as it were in favour towards God; and nothing else
but to offer to the author of truth the unclean sacrifice of a lie! ln the
corresponding passage of the De Augmentis, bk. i. (E. and S., vol. i. p.
436), be speaks rather more cautiously: ‘Liquet enirn Deum nihil operari
ordinario in natura uisi per secundas causas,' &c

‘⁰ Cp. tbe Temporis Partus Masculus (E. and S., vol. iii. p. 531), where,
in addressing Plato, be says: ‘Deinde etiam tu scelere haud minore
stultitiae apotheosin introduxisti, et vilissimas cogitationes religione munire
ausus es.'

‘¹ Bacon is probably alluding more especially to his contemporary
Dr. Robert Fludd (b. 1574, d. 1637), whose writings present a strange
jumble of physics, theology, and mysticism. He was the author of
many works ou seience and medicine, but the one to which Bacon pro·
bably here alludes is that entitled: ‘Utriusque Cosmi metaphysica,
physica atque technica historia‚' published iu 1617. A second volume
of this work appeared in1619, with the quaint title: ‘Tomus Secundus
De Supernaturali‚ Naturali, Praeternaturali, et Contranaturali Microcosmi
historia! Any one acquainted with the history of Gcology will recall
many striking illustrations, some of them comparatively recent, of Bacou's
criticism.

‘⁹ See Luke xxiv. 5. Cp. De Augmentis, lib. ix. (E. and S., vol. l. p. 83 5):
‘At in interpretandi modo Soluto duo interveniunt excessus: alter ejus·
modi praesupponit in Scripturis perfectionem, ut etiam omnis philosophia
ex earum fontibus peti debeat; acsi philosophia alia quaevis, res profana
esset et ethnica. Haec intemperies in schola Paracelsi praecipue, necnon
apud alios invaluit: initia autem ejus a Rabbinis et Cabalistis defluxerunt.
