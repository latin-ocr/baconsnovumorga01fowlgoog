Post Tabulas comparmatiae primae et rejectiomm sive cx·
clusiaam, nec non vindemiationem primam iactam secundum
eas, pergendum est ad reliqua auxilia intellectus circa iater-
pretatiomm reatarae et inductionem veram ac perfectam. In
quibus proponendis, ubi opus erit tabulis, procedemus super
calidum et frigidum, ubi autem opus erit tantum exemplis
paucioribus, procedemus per alia omnia: ut nec confundatur
inquisiti0, ettamen doctrina versetur minus in angusto.

Coelo, i. 3, ii. 7, and other places), was that the beavenly bodies are corn·
posed of an entirely different substance (a fifth essence, or clement) from
those which enter into the composition of sublunary bodies. Bacon,
while opposing this opinion, admits that there is no doubt ‘quin regiones
sub luna positae et supra, unacum corporibus quae sub iisdem spatiis con-
tinentur, multis et magnis rebus differant! See Descriptio Globi lntellec·
tualis, cap. 7 (E. and S.,v01.iit. p. 748, dcc).

On the expression ‘imbutum a coelestibus,’ cp. what Bacon says on
Astrology in De Augmentis, iii. 4 (E. and S, vol. i. pp. 5 54-60).

Ἀ* By this explanation he means that the ‘calidum ad sensum ' is simply
the ‘calidum in se' in its relation to our senses. ‘Calon’ as perceived by
us, is modiiied by the condition ol the percipient.

²⁸ ΜΓ. Ellis (pp. 266, 2⁶7) has an interesting note on various points
connected with the ‘Inquisitio de forma calidi) lt is too long to quote,
but the student may refer to it with advantage, bearing in mind, however,
that the dynamical theory of beat has gained considerably in evidence
since the time at which lllr. Ellis wrote. Most of the points touched on in
this note have been mentioned by me in the course of my own annotations.

The ‘ulteriora auxilia' are designed ior the purpose ol perfecting the
‘Exclusiva,’ ior which purpose the Tables alone are not supposed to be
sufficient. The necessary imperiection oi his method, in the present state
os knowledge, and with the present modes ol enquiry, is aclrnowledged
by Bacon himself in Aph. 19.

To the parenthetical character oi the Aphorism just concluded l bave
already drawn attention in the extracts irom Mr. Ellis' General Preface
in note 95 above.
