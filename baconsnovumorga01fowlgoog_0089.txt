66 INTRODUCTION.

difficult questions which presents itself in the course of human

s culation.
peIt is an entirely distinct question whether Bacon acted· rightly in

expelling the consideration os Final Causes so completely as he pro·

posed to do from the domain of Physics, and it is certainly a curious
commentary on his procedure that, at the very time when he was
composing the Novum Organum, Harvey was employing this very
mode of reasoning in the famous researches which resulted in the
discovery of the Circulation of the Blood⁵⁴. Nor would any one‚I
presume, now deny that the idea offanctrbn which implies so much
of the idea os Final Canse as is included in the word adaplalrbn
as distinct from dest'gn, is a conception absolutely essential to the
successful prosecution of at least one science, that of physiology.
And, even in the higher sciences ol psychology‚ ethics, and politice,
there are few enquirers who can avoid from time to time aslring the
question, what purpose does such and such a constituent subserve in
the mental, moral, or social economy. In chemistry, mineralogy,
and those branchos of science to which the word ‘physica’ is osten
restricted, such enquiries are much rarer, but 1 question whether there
is any single science, other than mathematical, from which the idea os
adaptation can be strictly and consistently excluded. How we are to
interpret the ¹fact of adaptation is a different question, and one which
by the great mass of scientific enquirers would now be answered in a
very different fashion lrom what ever occurred to any but a few
isolated thinkers in previous generations. The limits os this Intro-
duction being necessarily restricted, it is enough here simply to allude
to the theory of Evolution, and to works such as those ol Mr. Darwin,
Mr. wallace, and Mr. Herbert Spencer. To prevent, however, any
misconception of my own opinione, 1 cannot refrain from repeating
here what l have already said in another place, that the main drift of
the arguments employed in Natural Theology is not affected hythe
modern theory of Evolution. 1t Ι may be allowed to quote myself,
‘Iam larsrom denying that the Argument from Final causes, itit

of adapting themselves to external circumstances, and il it be based

Ἰ Harvey began publicly to teach this doctrine in 1619, though his work on the
subject was not published till 1⁶2⁸. His discovery set out from observing the
action os the valves in the velns ol many parts of the body. and enquiring into thei:
purpose, assuming, ot course, that they had some purpose or other.
