INTRODUC T ION. 85

we should follow experience and not Aristotle. But, at the same time,
he adopts afar more moderate tone than most of the writers whom
l have hitherto noticed. Thus, in the Preface ‘Ad Lectorem' he
states his position as follows: ‘Illud quidem affirmo, longe diversis
finibus contineri fidem et scientiam. Si Aristotelem volumus sapi·
entiae ducem, non abnuo: si doctrinae magistrum, non recuso: si
sapientiae parentem, agnosco in multis, maximisque rebuS, et admiror:
si ad illius solum suffragium imus in sententiam, si in illius tantum
pronunciatis conquiescimus, et ejus dicta, absque alia probatione, nobis
sentiendi norma sunt, non admitto: imo dico, qui sic faciunt longe
ab Aristotelis doctrina recedere: qui vult illum esse Philosophum, et
illum sapientem, qui rerum causas noverit, non qui alicujus dicta
memoriae consecravit!

These selections, which 1 have brought down to the time of Baton
himself, will be sufficient to shew the nature and strength of the
reaction against the philosophy of Aristode. From his more moderate
critics, or those who complained of the blind submission of his
followers rather than of the tone and method of the master himself,
such as Cardan and Galile0, 1 have not thought it necessary to
quote.

Bacon’s own criticisms, degenerating often into invectivas, will be
sufficiently illustrated from the Novum Organum and the parallel
passages which, from time to time, I shall quote from his other
writings.

Taking the main peculiarities of Bacon's mcthod and teaching to
have been—(1) the emphasis with which he insisted on the necessity
of consulting and collecting facts, of going straight to Nature, of
instituting observations and experimenta before formulating general
propositions: (a) the gradual ascent from propositions or axioms of
a lower to those of a higher degree of generality; (3) the selection
and comparison of instances in place of the old Inductio per Enume-
rationem Simplicem; (4) the disregard of Authority, and the restraint
of Fancy: we may proceed to enquire how far in these and other less
important armore detailed parts of his system, he was anticipated by
preceding writers. Now, it must be confessed at once that, in many
