sectton on its Bibliography) appears to have been commenced about

1608. When the first edition appeared in 1620, it was preceded by
the piece beginning, ‘Franciscus de Verulamio sic cogitavit’ or Dedi·
cation to the King, a Preface to the Instauratio Magna (of which,
though only the second part, it was the first instalment), me Distri-
butio Operis (that is, the plan of the whole Instaurationl, and a
Preface peculiar to itself. It was followed by a small tract, entitled
Parasceue ad Historiam Naturalem et Experimentalem‚ printed, by
anticipation, as a sort of specimen or, possibly, resume of the penulti-
mate part of the Novum Organum, promised in li. ar. Finally the
volume is closed bya Catalogus Historiarum Particularium Se·
cundum Capita, or list of desiderata in the specific materials for

dehteloHovum Organum. I need hardly remark, is only a fragment

of the much larger work which Bacon contemplated under that title,
as adequately representing the second part of the Great Instauration.
The enumeration of the 'parts wanting will be found in Book ii.
Aph. ar, and, again, though less distinctly, in Aph. 52. Nevertheless,
though only a fragment, the Novum Organum, and especially the first
Book, is the most carefully written of all Bacon's philosophical works.
According to Rawley¹¹, it was written out twelve several times, and
we have just seen by what a number of essays the final effort was
preceded. Moreover, as describing the new method of which the
renovation of knowledge was to be the result, it was the keystone
uf Bacon's entire system.

The Third Part of the Great Instauration is designated Phaeno-
mena Universi, sive Historia Naturalis et Experimentalis ad corr·
dendam Philosophiam, and was to contain a collection of arranged
and sifted materials on which the method of induction wasto work.
Of this part, even according to Bacon’s limited conception of the
extent and variety of nature, we have only a very small portion, and,
according to ajuster estimate of the boundless extent of the ‘Phaeno-
mena Universi,' that portion rnight almost be described as infini-
tesimal Such as it ie, however, it is contained mainly in the
Historia Ventorum, the Historia Vitae et Mortis, the Historia Densi
et Rari, the Sylva Sylvarum‚ and the New Atlantis. In the year 1622
Bacon published a small volume entitled Historia Naturalis, &c.,
quae est Instaurationis Magnae Pars Tertia. In the beginning of
