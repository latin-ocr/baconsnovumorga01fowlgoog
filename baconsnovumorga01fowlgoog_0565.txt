are so osten repeated and varied in the course ol his writings, that it
is difficult to know how sar his opinions are represented by any particular i
passage.

‘lt is well to remark that, to a certain extent, the theory here so de·
cidedly condemned has, by the recent progress of organic chemistry, been
shown to be true. Nothing seems better established than that the nitro·
genised components ol animal bodies are derived from the corresponding
elements ol their food. With respect to sat, it is, Ι believes prevailing
opinion at present, that animals have the power of converting into it the ,
starch or sugar ol their sood [see Miller's Organic Chemlstry‚ Elements ol
Chemistry, 4th Ed, vol. iii. ς 1718]; and the productiori of butyric acid
by fermentation has been regarded as at least an illustration of the
transformation. One of the highest authorities on such a subject, however,
l mean Μ. Boussingault, wae, at least afew years ago, of a different opinion.
He regarded animal fat as the representative os the fatty matters contained
in the food.’

¹⁹ Paracelsus is very fond of this analogy. Thus, in the De Morbis
Tartareis, cap. 3, he says: ‘Ac insuper Archaeum loco et vice fabri praesto
esse debeat! Hallarn (History of Literature, part i. ch. 7. §§ 17-20) gives
a short account of the whimsical theories ol Paracelsus. For a longer
account, see Sprengel, Geschichte der Araneykunde, Th. lii. Kap. ro.

²⁰ On the distinction between the ‘spiritus mortualis’ and the ‘spiritus
vitalis‚’ see Historia Vitae et Mortis, E. and 8., vol. ii pp. ²¹4-7·

lnmcpppnip syl), viii, he makes the same remarks as in the present passage.
