his objections anticipated‚ il indeed they did not suggest, some ol
the leading criticisms in the two works which follow.

Lasson's monograph on Bacon (Gustav Lange, Berlin, 1860)
appeared in the Jahresbericht iiber die Louisenstadtische Realschule«
Though it only extends over thirty-two peges, it is the weightiest ol ⁴
the attacks upon Bacon which Ι have seen. It is written not only
with more moderatim, but with more knowledge ol Bacon's writings
and with more syrnpathy with the philosophical spirit in its relation
to science, than is the violent diatribe os Liebig, to bc next noticed.
The writer dwells with much emphasis on the scientific progress
which had been already made in Bacon’s time, and maintains that the
reformation ol science was not the work of a single man, but
the gradual productos the age. Moreover, the necessity ol ln·
duction, the appeal to Observation and Experiment, and the practical
aims which should be kept in view in seientific enquiry, had been
insisted ou by a host ol writers before Bacon gave utterance to them.
Having, thus, combated Bacon’s claim to originality, he next proceeds
to an examination of his system. Here, he finds special lauit with his
mechanical theory ol induction, the manner in which he ignores
the activity ol the Understanding (Verstandesthtitigkeit), his criticism
ol Final Causes, his conception of Forrns, his neglect ol quantitative
relations, tte. Lasson, like Liebig, is especially severe on the Sylva
Sylvarum, which he says might have been more appropriately written
in the eleventh than in the seventeenth century. Finally‚ he puts the
question, ‘Was Baeon really a Philosopher,’ and he answers that,
in the proper sense ol the word, he was not ; he was a genius, hut, at
the same time, a Dilettante (ein geistreicher Dilettant). ‘Es lasst
sich die Frage stellen, ob er ttberhaupt ein Philosoph gewesen, und
wir denken, die Frage beantwortet sich von selbst in negativem Sinne,
wenn man nicht das Wort Philosophie in ungebithrlich weitem Sinne
lasst. Ans allgemeinen Gesichtspunkten raisonniren ist noch nicht
philosophiren. * ⁴¹ * * * In allem diesem kritischen Hochmuth, wie
in der dogrnatischen Zuversicht und in dem Unvermdgen, Positives
zu schaffen, ist Baco ein rechter Vertreter der grossen Masso, des
ganz unwissenschaftlichen Bewusstseins. * * * l * Baeo ist ein geist·
reicher Dilettant, er hat etwas von Cicero und von Voltaire. Der
beriihmte Harvey hat mit Recht von ihm-gesagt: er schreibe tiber
Philosophie, wie ein Lord-kanzler.' That Bacon, however, did great

servicem spreading a taste for experimental enquiry and in drawing
the popular attention to the importance ol consulting laets, is allowed
throughout the enquiry.
