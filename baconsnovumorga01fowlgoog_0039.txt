16 INTRODUCTION.

The fact is that Bacon lived too early or too late to take any serious
part in these metaphysica} discussions. In their scholastic form they
had become discredited, and their new form, under which they were to
exercise so much of the best thought of the two succeeding centuries,¹
had not yet been impressed on them by the genius of Descartes.
Bacon assumes the ordinary distinction of mind and matter, an
universe of objects to be known and a thinking subject capable, with
due care and discipline, of attaining to a knowledge of them, without,
apparently, troubling himself asto the ulterior questions, what is
,² knowledge, how can I become conscious of that which is not myself,
and what are the ultimate meaning and relation of the two terms in
this comparison. ’

On questions of psychology, as distinct from metaphysics, we find
a fair number of passages in Bacon's writings. The most important
perhaps of these are those in which, following Telesiusn, he asserta
the duality of the human soul. Man, according to this doctrine (which
is stated most fully in De Augmentis‚ iv. 3), has two souls, one
peculiar to himself, the rational soul which he derives from the
breath of God, the other, shared by him in common with the brutes,

the irrational soul, which comes from ‘the wombs of the elements.¹

altera tractat de Anima Rationali, quae divina est; altera de Irra- ,
