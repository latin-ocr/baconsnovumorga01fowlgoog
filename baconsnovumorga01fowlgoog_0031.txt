in the Partis Secundae Delineatio, as Mr. Spedding remarks in his
Preface to that work (vol. iii. p. 544), ‘the description of the ntent- “
tratri) ad Ratrbnem adds something to what we otherwise know con*
cerning those parts of the inductive process which were to have
been developed in the third book of the Novum Organum' Ap·
pended to the Delineatio in Ellis and Spedding's Edition is a tract
called Redargutio Philosophiarum⁸‚ which, says tttr. Spedding,
‘may be considered as the first chapter of the second part of the
Instauratio, as it was then designed.’ It consists, as its name implies,
of an attack upon preceding systems of philosophy, and, though
designed to be part of the work of which the Delineatio is the
sketch, was probably not composed till some time afterwards ⁹.
Closely resembling the Redarguti0, but far more arrogant in its
tone, is the extant portion of another work entitled Temporis
Partus Masculus sive De Interpretatione Naturae Libri Tres. Of
this the first and second chapters only exist, the second, as ΜΓ.
Spedding thinks, written at a considerable interval after the first,
though before the Redarguti0. This second chapter goes orer the
same ground as the Redargutio and the aphorisms on the Idola
Theatri in the Novum Organum‚ but is written in a peculiarly arro·
gant, not to say, insolent tone. Mr. Spedding conjectures, 1 think
rightly, that this arrogance and exaggeration are to be explained on
the supposition that Bacon was making an experiment in the art of
commanding attention and winning disciples ¹⁰. If he spoke loud
enough, and used sufficiently strong language‚ he thought he might
compel men to listen to him. To me the whole performance seems
to have a strained and almost theatrical character.

- The composition of the Novum Organum (as 1 have shown in the

⁸ In Isaac Gruter's Fdition, only a small portion of the Redargutio (namely to
the words ‘in chorum receptis‚' E. and S, vol. iii. p. 561) follows the Delineatio.
But in the Appendix to Mallet's Life of Bacon (1760), the same tract, with the
title. beginning at the words ‘Dum haec tractarem’ (E. and S, p. 558), is printed
for the tirst time from the Harleian MSS. Thus, the two copies orer-lap, arrd
Mr. Spedding has restored the tract by piecing them together.

⁹ See Mr. Spedding's Preface. vol. iii. pp. 544-546.

¹⁰ In the Preface to the Delineatio (p. 545lr Mr. Spedding quotes, amongst
others. the two following entries from Bacon's Diary (the Commentarius Solutus),
dated Jnly 26, 1608:

‘Discoursing scornfnlly of the philosophy of the Grecians, with some better
respect to the AEgyptians, Persians, Caldees, and the utmost antiquity, and the
mysteries of the poets.’

‘Comparing the case with that which Livy sayeth of Alexander, Nil aliud φιν-ω
bene ausus varra contemnere!
