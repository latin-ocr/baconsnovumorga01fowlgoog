³² The retention of images on the retina of the eye is a famssiar pheno- l

menon, of which the reader will easily supply himself with instances. The κ

duration of the persistence varies with the intensity of the light and the
sensitiveness of the orgau. ‘M. Platean has investigated the duration of
the impression by numerous methods, and has found that it ison the
average half a second. s ι ι Α great number of pieces of apparatus are
founded on the persisteuce of sensation on the retina. Such are the
thaumatrope, the phenakistoscope‚ Faraday’s wheel, the kaleidophone.’
Ganot’s Physics, t 588 (8th Ed, t 607).

θ’ Mr. Ellis says that ‘in the case of vibrating strings Bacon’s explana·
tion is not altogether complete. The distinct or quasi-distinct images to
which he refers correspond to limiting positione of the vibrating string.’

⁸⁴ ‘This account of Galileo’s theory of the tides is inaccurate. ln this
theory the tides are caused hythe varying velocity of different points of
the earth's surface, arising from the composition of the earth’s two
motions, namely that about its axis, and that in its orbit. Bacon does not
seem to have perceived that both these motions are essential to the
explanation. That the earth’s being in motion might be the cause of the
tides, had been suggested before the time of Galileo by Caesalpinus in the
Qraestiones Peripateticae, iii. 5. lt is odd that Patritius, in giving an
account of all the theories which had in his time been devised to explain
the cause of the tides (see his Pancosmla, l. 28), does not mention
Caesalpinus’, though it was published some years before his own work.
Galileo perhaps alludes to Caesalpinus in his letter to Cardinal Orsino,
dated 8thJanuary,1616. See, for remarks on Caesalpinus' doctrine, the
Problemata Marina of Casmann, published in ¹⁵9⁶· Casmann's own
theory is that of expansion! Mr. Ellis' note. See also my notes on
Aph. 36 (ι). Galileo's Theory of the Tides will be found stated at length
in his Dialogo dei Massimi Sistemi, Glornata Quarta.
