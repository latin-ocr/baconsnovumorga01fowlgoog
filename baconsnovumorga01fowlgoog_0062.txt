INTRODUCTION. 39

the necessity os combining the explanations ol celestial and terrestrial
phenomena, we pass by a'natural transition to the famous passages
on Attraction. ln the Lettres sur les Anglois (1728-1730), which,
though they certainly did not create, undoubtedly did much to revive
the celebrity ol Bacon in France, Voltaire says at the end ol a long
eulogium: ‘Mais ce qui m’a le plus surpriS, c'a 616 de voir dans
son livre en termes expres, cette Attraction nouvelle dont M. Newton
passe pour l’inventeur ¹.’ And the Article on Bacon in the Diction·
naire Philosophique begins: ‘Le plus grand service peut-stre que
Franpois Bacon ait rendu a la philosophie a ete de deviner l’attraction.'
This praise, as I have said in the section on Bacon’s Influence on
Philosophy and Science, I believe to be greatly exaggerated, sor it
was the discovery of the precise Law of Attraction and its illustration
in so many departments oi nature rather than the mere divination of
its influence which constituted the peculiar merit oi Newton ; but, at
the same time, lew, I think, can read the passages in Bacon, where
he alludes to this subject, and fail to recognise their remarkable
character. Even allowing lor Gilbert's influence¹, I think that the
passage in Nov. Org. ii. 36 (3), and the Instantia Crucis there
proposed (the reader will do well to study the whole of this section
with care), do great credit to Bacon's sagacity, and, evenis they stood
alone, would entitle him to some place in the lsrstory ol Science⁸.
Not only does he suggest the attraction os the earth’s mass as the
cause of the sall of heavy bodies, but he adds that, ii thisbe the
cause, the nearer the bodies approach the earth, the more strongly and
with the greater force will they be drawn towards it, while, the further
oli they are, the weaker and the slower will be their motions. Moreover,
the experiment proposed is itsell very ingenious, and is, in principle,
no other than that reeently used in the series os scientific observatione
instituted in the Dolcoath and Harton Collieries ⁴. With this passage,
which is, however, the most remarkable, the student may compare
what Bacon says⁶ on the same subject in Nov. Org. ii. 35, 37, 48 (9),

¹ As I have remarked in my note on the Text, even il the idea was suggested to
Bacon by the work ol Gilbert, he ought, at least, to haye the credit ol having de-
tached the conception ol attraction lrom that ol magnetism.

os Natural Philosophy, t 196.

⁴ See the remarks os Sir John Herschel referred to above, and Mr. Ellis’s note on
the passage. In my own note. 1 have pointed out certain delects in the experiment
