Etiam canones praedominaatiarum qui occurrunt colligendi
sunt. Veluti, quod quo communius est bonurn quod appetitur,
eo motus est fortior⁷1 ut motus nexus, qui respicit commu·
nionem universi, fortior est motu gravitatis, qui respicit com·
munionem densorum. Etiam quod appetitus qui sunt boni
privati, non praevalent plerunque contra appetitus boni magis
publici, nisi in parvis quantis. Quae utinam obtinerent in

that‚ in both cases alike, the force of gravity is acting at every moment of
the projectile’s path; nor was he aware, of course, that the path of the
projectile, if we leave out of account the resistance of the atmosphere, is
in all cases a parabola. The experiment proposed is to ascertain how far

agun will carry point-blank, and then, firing that distance, first upwards, ,
then downwards, to compare the force of the two shots. As the velocity 1

at any point of the parabola is that which would be acquired in falling
from the directrix, there can be no doubt that the downward shot would
make much the greater impression of tbe two. But, as it is almost need·
less to add, Bacon entirely mistook the conditions of the problem. ¹

The true theory of the motion of projectiles was first distinctly enun-

ciated by Galileo in the fourth of his Dialogues on Motion, which were ῗ
- published at Leyden in 1⁶ 38 (Dialoghi delle Nuove Scienze, Giornata is, 3

Florence Ed, vol. xiii. p. 222, δια). On the previous speculations of
Tartalea, Digges, dec, see Whewell’s History of the lnductive Sciences,

vol. ii. bk. vi. cb. a. sect. 3, and Drinkwater's Life of Galileo (Lib. Soc. ᾖ

U. K.), ch.16. lt is curious that one of the books (the Pantometria.
published in r 591), in which Thomas Digges alludes to the compounded
motion ofa projectile, was dedicated to Sir Nicholas Bacon, Bacou’s

father. Aseries of very interesting remarhs'on this subject will be found κ

at the end of the strationem, published by Digges in 1579.
²¹ Note this strange application of the doctrine of F inal Causes, and the
very doubtful example by which it is supported. =
On Public and Private Good‚ cp. the interesting passages in De Augm. ÷

vii. 1 (E. and 8., vohi. p. 717, &c.), or Advancement of Learning, bk. ii. ’
(E. and 8., vol. iii. p. 420, &c.). The application of this distinction to l
‘judge and determine the controversies wherein Moral Philosophy is J
conversant' has a peculiar interest in reference to subsequent ethical y

speculation.

⁷² These are the first of the three ‘ Instantiae propitiae sive benevolae' ἶ
(see Aph. 44). Their office is ‘dirigere operativarn ad eaquae maxime
hominum intersunt! Hence, they are called ‘intimating lnstances;’ for l
