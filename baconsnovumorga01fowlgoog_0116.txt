The constant appeals to experience made by Paracelsus (1493-
1541) are recognised by Bacon himself in the Temporis Partus
Masculus (R and S, vol. iii. p. 538): ‘Denique Paracelsum et
Severinum [sc. Petrum, 1542-1602], curn tantis clamoribus homines
ad experientiae suggestum convocant, praecones mihi exopto! He
goes on, however, to say that the appeal to experience was in itself
by no means sufficient to conduct them to tmth. ‘Quid igitur? Num

Ι veritatis compotes isti? Nihilo minus! And, towards the end of the

treatise (p. 539), he adds: ‘Ego vero (fili), si te jamjam animo ab
idolis non repurgato vertiginosis experientiae ambagibus committerem,
nae tu ducem cito desiderares! Paracelsus (as 1 have elsewhere
noticed) is specially emphatic in his rejection of authority.

Remusat (pp. 388-390), following De Gerando, bestows what ap·
pears to me the most exaggerated praise on a small work, published at
Basle in 1558, by Acontio or Contio, entitled ‘De Methodo sive recta
investigandarum tradendarumque artium ac scientiarum ratione! It
seems to me ridiculous to insinuate, as Remusat appears to do, that
Bacon was under special obligations to a work, from which, indeed,
there was little to borrow. The book is, for the time at which it was
written, a clear and useful little treatise on the practical applications
of Logic to study and teaching, but it discusses the four causes,
definition, division, and the like, rather than induction and the kindred
topics of observation, experiment, dre. The only partos it which
admits of comparison with the Novum Organum is pp. 75-78,
Leyden Ed.,1617. Speaking of Division, he says that, before we
divide, we ought to know ‘totum ipsum, quod dividendum sit.
Quamobrem, si forte in promptu non sit, indagare illud opportebit ab
aliquorum singularium inspectione’ He then shews how we may
arrivs at a knowledge of the whole from an examination of particular
instances, ‘abstrahendo semper illa universa a singularibus! He
proceeds to say that the likenesses of diverse things are the means
by which we arrive at our knowledge of the whole: ‘quamobrem
perscrutari illam similitudinem quarn diligentissime in rebus dissimilibus
necesse est! But, surely, this hasbeen a common-place of logicians
from the days of Socrates and Plato downwards.

The principal object of this work seems to be to recommend the
‘methodus resolutiva' or analytic method, the method of working
buckwards from the effect to the cause, or the end to the means,
in preference to the ‘methodus compositiva’ or synthetic method.

Telesio (1509-1588), whom he himself calls the ‘best of the
novellists,' Bacon had no doubt read with great care, and in his works
