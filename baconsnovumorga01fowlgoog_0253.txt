dicemus, quum ad modum et rationem constituendi notiones

peculiarly simple and are performed with such rapidity and, for the most
part, at so early an age, that we are hardly conscious of having ever gone ·
through them. Hence, we are able almost at once to construet definitions
for the purpose of explaining the most important distinctions which we
either lind obtruded on our notice, or think it desirable to establish.
Moreover, these definitione, when constructed, do not pretend to represent
concrete facts but only certain abstract relations of figures and numbers.
That such relations exist, if not strictly, at least approximately, no one
¹ disputes; they can generally be expressed ina few words, which adequately
and exhaustively represent them, and a single technical term is easily
invented or appropriated, by means of which the delinition ean in future
be summoned before the mind. About the adequacy or correctness of
these definitions there is seldom any difference of opinion, and, even if
there be, it does not affeet the validity of the subsequent reasoning; for,
provided that the same relation be invariably designated by the same
name, and that the logical operations be correctly performed, there can
beno errorin the result. But, when we come to deal with the complex
relations of nature and life, it is widely different. Here, Induction occu·
pies a far more important place, and till we have ascertained‚ distinguished,
and classified the more important propertles of the objeets under investi-
gation, it is in vain to begin the work of Definition. lt is only after
we have completed the inductive stage of the enquiry that we are in a
position to draw upa list of definitions, or, if we venture to do so before,
we ought to regard them simply as incomplete and provisional, and hold
ourselves in constant readiness to review and correct them. Hence,
while the inductive stage of a science is progressive, and therefore
incomplete, it is natural that much controversy should tum on the
definitione. ‘lt is necessary,' as Bacon says, ‘to be constantly recurring
to particular instances,' and we cannot safely reason deductively from
the definitions as data, till we have finnly established the inductions on
which they rest, and of which they are frequently the expressions, and,
indeed, tle summaries.

On the nature and place of Definition in Mathematics, the student may
refer to Dugald Stewart's Section, entitled ‘Of Mathematical Demon-
stration,’ in the Philosophy of the Human Mind (Hamilton's Ed, vol. il.
pp. 113-152), and Mill’s Logic, blr. ii. ebs. 5, ⁶3 and on the distinction
between ‘F inal and Complete’ and ‘lncomplete and Provisional’ Deh-
nitions‚ to the Editor's chapter on Definitions in hIs Elements of De·
ductive Logic.
