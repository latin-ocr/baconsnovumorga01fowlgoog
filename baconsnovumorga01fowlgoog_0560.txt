than that of the earth. Whether referred to the bellocentric or geocentrlc
system, the peculiarities of these planete early attracted attention. On the
geocentric hypothesis, it was doubted whether their orbits were superior
or inferior to that of the sun. Bacon starts various questions with re·
gard to them in the Descriptio Globi intellectualis (E. and S, vol. iii.
nv· 746-7)·

As to the words ‘ne longius absint ' dec, the best commentary on thern
will be found in Herschel’s Outlines oi Astronomy, § 467, dcc. Hersehel
begins his account of the motions of these planets almost in the very
words of Bacon: ‘Two of the planets-Mercury and Venus-perform their
circuit evidently as attendants upon the sun, from whose vicinity they never
depart beyond a certain limit.’

⁴ The following excellent remarks on this section are made by Dr.
Hippus in his Account of the Novum Organurn in the Library oi Useful
Knowledge: ‘Motus fugae, or the motion of avotdance, though very crudely
and almost ludicrously illustrated by Bacon, has its foundation in fact, and
is that property of matter which is now called repulsione. Newton found
that a convex lens, when put upon a flat glass remained at the distance of
the fifth part of an inch; and that a very considerable force was requisite
to diminish this distance. Again, though steel is so much heavier than its
bulk of water, yet if a dry needle be placed carefully upon the suriace ola
basin of water, it will float3 the repulsion of the water preventing its
sinking. Also the particles of all geues seem to repel each other, as appears
from their elasticity. According to Boscovich, the atoms of which bodies
are composed are capable of acting on each other with a force, which
differs in intensity, and in kind, according to the distance. At sensible
distances the force isattracn've, and diminishes inversely as the squares of
the distance. At the smallest distances the force is repulsiva- it increases
as the distance 'diminishes3 and at last becomes infinite or insuperable.
Hence if Boscovich's theory be correct, absolute contact, however para·
doxical this may appear, is impossible. Facts, at all events, prove, in many
cases, a repulsive power, whatever be its precise laws3 and to these facts
may be added, though sornewhat differing from the former examples, the
repulsion of electrified pith balls; also of the similar poles of two magnete.
ln the latter case, all the force of a strong man has proved insufficient to
make the two north poles touch each other.' Other instances might be
found in the fact that some chemical elements,so far as we know at present,
will not combine with other elements (as, for instance, oxygen with huncine),
while others only combine with great difficulty; or, again, ln certain pheno·
mena of repulsion partly due to capillarity, as, for example, in the fact,
