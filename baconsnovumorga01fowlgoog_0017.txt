marvellous, as well as the fanciful views of nature which then
prevailed.

The section of my Introduction which treats of Bacon's
Influence on Philosophy and Science should have contained
some notice of the testimony of Barrow‚ an account of which
will be found in Whewell’s Philosophy of Discovery, pp.
177-9. This author, writing in 1652, had evidently, as Dr.
Whewell says, ‘read the Novum Organum in a careful and
intelligent manner, and presumed his Cambridge hearers to
be acquainted with the work.'

.In this section (p. 108), I have referred, following Mr.
Macvey Napier, to Comenius (b. in Moravia 1592, d. 1671,
many of whose works were published at Leszno in Poland),
as having in his Physicae Synopsis spoken in laudatory
terms of Bacon. But I was not aware, till Mr. Pattison
directed my attention to the fact, that the educational
works of Comenius are so full of allusions to Bacon, or
that the thoughts and modes of expression of this writer
are so Baconian in character as I find to be the case. If
any reader cares to pursue this subject, he will find an ex·
cellent example of what I mean in the Pansophici Libri
Delineatio (occupying pp. 403-456 of the first Part of the
Opera Didactica, published at Amsterdam, in 1657). Speaking
of rules for distinguishing the true from the false, Comenius
says: ‘Atque talem normam in natura-scrutanda reperisse
visus est Illustrissimus' Verulamius, artificiosam quandam in-
ductionem, quae revera in naturae abdita penetrandi reclusa
via est. Verum enimvero, quia haec plurium hominum
et seculorum continuatam industriam poscit, atque adeo tum
operosa, tum a successu quasi incerto suspensa videtur, fit,
ut praeclarum inventum a plerisque tanquam inutile con·
temnatur.’ In a previous passage, he asks: ‘Non est nihil,
quod Verulamius mirabili suo organo rerum naturas intime
scrutandi modurn infallibilem detexiti’ This work was pub·
lished at Oxford in the year 1637, under the title of Conatuum
Comenianorum Praeludia.

In the Preface to the Physicae ad Lumen Divinum
Reformatae Synopsis Amst. 1643, referred to in my Intro·
duction, he speaks of the Instauratio Magna as Δ ‘opus
