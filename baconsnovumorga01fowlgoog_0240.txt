'hoc malum in philosophiis et scientiis3 inquibus quod semel
placuit, reliqua (licet multo firmiora et potiora) inficit, et in
ordinem redigit. Quinetiam licet abluerit ea, quarn diximus,
delectatio et vanitas, is tamen humano intellectui error est
proprius et perpetuus, ut magis moveatur et excitetur affirma·
tivis, quam negativis; cum rite et ordine aequum se utrique
praebere debeat; quin contra, in omni axiomate vero consti·
tuendo, major est vis instantiae negativae ⁶⁷. ’

Intellectus humanus illis, quae simul et subito mentem
ferire et subire possunt, maxime movetur3 a quibus phan-
tasia impleri et inflari consuevit: reliqua vero modo quodam,
licet imperceptibili, ita se habere fingit et supponit, quomodo
se habent pauca illa quibus mens obsidetur 68; ad illum vero
transcursum ad instantias remotas et heterogeneas ⁶³, per quas

⁶² Α single negative instance, il it admit of no explanation, is sufficient
to upset a theory, or, at the least, it ought to cause us to suspend our
judgment, till we are able either to explain the exception, or to modify
the theory in accordance with it, or else to accumulate such an amount oi
negative evidence as to justify us in rejecting the theory altogether. The
negative instance, even where it does not upset a theory, is often peculiarly
'valuable, in calling attention to a counteracting cause. This, lor example,
was the case with the deflections of the planet Uranus, which, being
inexplicable by ,known causes, directed the attention of astronomers to
the existence of a hitherto undiscovered planet, the planet now called
Neptune. An example, on the other hand, ol a theory which was upset
by a single negative instance, is the old doctrine that bodies fall to the
ground in times inversely proportioned to their weights3 the experiments
of Galileo from the leaning tower of Pisa once and lor ever put an end
to this delusion.

Bacon may possibly, however, be referring to the method ol Exclusions,
of which we shall hear so much in the Second Boolr. On this method, see
Introduction, § 9.

⁸⁸ The mind is unduly influenced by sudden and simultaneous impressions.
hlamiliar example of this tendency is the unreasoning alarm osten pro-
duced by railway accidents, accidents in mines, collierieS, etc. Such
accidents, especially ir two or more occur about the same time, ‘lili the
imagination’ and excite an alann out of all proportion to the actual risk
incurred.

θ’ Thus, the pheuomena oi electriclty are exhibited on a grand scale in
thunder and lightning, which ‘strilre the mind suddenly and simultaneously,’
but the study of these instances alone would never have led to the
