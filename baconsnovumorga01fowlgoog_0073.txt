attempting to extract it; while, in the wide field of nature, the harvest
was ready, though the labourers were few. And so Bacon contented
himself with working in what appeared to him the more promising
field of labour. He sought God in nature, and there he recognised‚
reverenced, and adored Him. The same God was also to be found
in the arlr of the Church‚ and the pages of the Bible; but Bacon's
tastes and pursuits lay another way, and hence, though he had no
inclination to call in question the leading verities of saith, he received
them, always without enthusiasm, and sometimes, even, with apparent
indiffereuce.

yth. ¹This last consideration may afford some explanation of the
two other points to which I shall call attention. One of these is
the evident preference which Bacon accords to Atheism over Super·
stition. ‘It were better to have no opinion of God at all, than such
an opinion as is unworthy of him. For theone is unbelief, the
other is contumely: and certainly superstition is the reproach of
the Deity. Plutarch saith well to that purpose: Surely (saith he) I hod
rather o great deal men should roy there war no such man ol all os
Plutarch, lhon thot thy should roy thal there roas one Plutarch thor
would eal his children as soon ar they were torm as the poets spealr
of Saturn. And as the contumely is greater towards God, so the
danger is greater towards men. Atheism leaves aman to sense, to
philosophy, to natural piety, to laws‚ to reputation 5 all which may
be guides to an outward moral virtue, though religion 'were not ; but
superstition dismounts all these, and erecteth an absolute monarchy
in the minds of men. Therefore atheism did never perturb states 3
for it makes men wary of themselves, as looking no further: and
we see the times inclined to atheism (as the time of Augustus Caesar)
were civil times. But superstition hath been the confusion of many
states, and bringeth in a new promum mobile, that ravisheth all the
spheres of govemment²⁴.' ln this passage, l thinlr, Bacon thoroughly
represents the spirit of his time. The recoil from the superstitious
of the Church of Rome, and especially from the dangers with which

the machinations of that Church seemed to threaten the civil power,
had become, in the reformed countries, so intense, and almost so
unreasoning, that men could conceive of no opinions equally dangerous
either to the well-being of the individual conscience or to the security

Romanism (Spedding's letters and Life, vol. iv. p. 10), where we find pretty nearly
