⁷³ These instances are, perhaps, slightly exaggerated. But, so far as
they are true, they are well explained by the following extract from
Mr. Bain’s ‘Senses and lntellect,’ 3rd Ed, pp. 158-9: ‘Tastes, properly
so called, affect only the gustatory nervae, and are therefore the same
whether the nostrils are opened or closed. But many sapid bodies are
also odorous. ln the act of expiration accompanying mastication, especi-
ally the instant after deglution, the odorous particles are carried into the
canities of the hose, and affert the sense of smell, or malre their odom
apparent. This effect is what we term flavour. Some bodies, as
cinnamon, have hardly any taste, but a flavour, in other words au odour,
brought out by mastication’

⁷¹ lt must be borne in mind, however, that, though the sensations of
smell and taste are closely associated, and their organs are in close
proximity, they are still perfectly distinct.

⁷⁵ ln the case of both taste and smell, the precise mode of action on the
urgan is very obscure, but, in each case, it is probably chemlcal. Touch
is, of course, a condition common to all the five external senses, various as
they are in their characteristics, and impossible as it is to reduce them, one
to the other.
