Jean Baptiste Du Hamel, the well-known author oi the Philosophia
Vetus et Nova, and the first Secretary oi the Academy ol Sciences‚ in
his work De Mente Humana, published in 1672, gives a long account
of the Baconian method (lib. iii. capp. 7-9), and, in speaking ol
Induction, says: ‘Verulamius primus hoc argumentum tractavit uber·
rime,’ ‘Hoc argumentationis genus aVeruiamio tractatum uberrime
et ab aliis fere neglectum? It is plain, therefore, that he regarded
Bacon as virtually the author ol the Inductive or Experimental
Method.

Bayle (whose Dictionary was first published in 1697) says little
ol Bacon, though, as Mr. Napier points out, he says nothing at all,
in the shape of a separate article, ol either Galileo or Descartes But
the meagreness ol his account is no proos oi disparagement. For he
calls Bacon ‘un des plus grans Esprits de son siecle, et l'un de ceux
qui connotent le plus doctement l'impersection oh etoit laPhilosophie.’
He adds: ‘Il travailla sortement aux molens d'y remedier, et il forma
de tres-beans pians de reformation. Le public recut favorablement
ses Ouvrages.'

This evidence (which, 1 believe, might be greatly extended¹³) is
sufficient to shew that Bacon's name was, atthis period, well known
in France, and that his merits were recognised by some oi the iore·
most men in philosophy and science. So inaccurate is the statement
of Montucla¹⁸, accepted by Dugald Stewart, and since frequently
repeated, that the celebrity oi Bacon's writings in Franco hardly dates
back beyond the appearance ol the Encyclopedie.

Itis unquestionable, however, that the patronage of Voltaire and
the Encyclopedists did much to extend the study of Bacon's writings,

besides producing a considerable controversy as to his true meaning
on many questions of philosophy and theology (see section on the

Bibliography ol the Novum Organum). Voltaire devoted to Bacon the
twellth of his Lettres sur les Anglois (172'8-1730), and directed special

Bacon,' ‘oes paroles sort judicieuses :' 'omnes perceptiones tarn sensus quam mentis

It rnay here be mentioned that a French translation of the De fingmentis appeared
in Paris in 1624, the very year aster the first publication of the work, and another
in 1632. On an early MS. translation ol the Novum Organum, which exists in the
Bibliotheque Nationale, see a note on the lust section ol this Introduction.
