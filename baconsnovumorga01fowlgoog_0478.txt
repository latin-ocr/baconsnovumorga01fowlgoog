ad alliciendum gravia non extendatur ultra orbern virtutis
suae (quae operatur semper ad distantiam certam, et non
ultra), hocque per aliquam instantiam verificetur3 ea demum
erit instantia foederis circa hoc subjectumffl. Neque tamen
occurrit impraesentiarum aliqua instantia super hoc certa et
manifesta. Proxime videntur accedere cataractae coeli⁰⁴, quae
in navigationibus per Oceanum Atlanticum versus Indias
utrasque saepe conspiciuntur. Tanta enim videtur esse vis
et moles aquarum quae per hujusmodi cataractas subito
effunditur, ut videatur collectio aquarum fuisse ante facta,
atque in his locis haesisse et mansisse; et postea potius per
causam violentam dejecta et detrusa esse, quam naturali motu
gravitatis cecidisse3 adeo ut conjici possit, corpoream molem
densam atque compactam in magna distantia a terra sore
pensilem tanquam terram ipsam, nec casuram nisi dejiciatur.
Verum de hoc nil certi affirmamus. Interim in hoc et in

the book, and is defined, at the beginning, as ‘totum illud spatium, per
quod quaevis magnetis virtus extenditur!

The phenomena of gravitation, it must be recollected, are explained by
Gilbert as cases oi magnetism.

ω Both this and the next case, Bacon conceived, would afford examples .

of lnstantiae F oederis,.by proving that heavy bodies, though left free, may
be at rest. They show how immature were his conceptions of motion, as
well as oi gravity.

⁶⁴ On the phenomena ol Whirlwinds, Waterspouts, and Dust-Stomrq
see Sir John Herschel’s Meteorology, pp. 241-7. After describing Whirl·
winds, he says: ‘They are often terminated by heavy falls of rain, a very
obvious consequence oi the sudden transfer of a great mass of air nearly
saturated with vapour at the sursace oi the earth to a much higher level!
lle then continues: ‘Whirlwinds oi this kind taking place at sea give rise
to waterspouts (trombes de mer), which are very singular and sometimes
dangerous phenomena. Tall columns, apparently of cloud, and reaching
from the sea to the clouds, are seen moving majestically along, often
several at once, sometimes straight and vertical, at others inclined and
tortuouS, but always, when approached, perceived to be in rapid rotation.
At their bases the sea is violently agitated, and heaped up with a leaping or
boiling motion. lndeed, water would seem, at least in some caseS, to be
actually carried up in considerable quantity, and scattered round from
a great height, as solid bodies are on laud. Hence they have been
supposed by some to draw water from the sea by sucdon, a thing obviously
im ossible.'

it is needless to point out how crude is both Bacon's account and his
explanation oi these phenomena.
