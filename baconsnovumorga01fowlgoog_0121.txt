sense, as restricted to enquiries into the constitution and modes oi
action oi corporeal objects).

With respect to the iirst question, l can only state strongly my
own belief that the most characteristic school os English psychologists
and moralists, and, through them, a most important school ol Eu·
ropean philosophy, has been profoundly influenced by the method
and speculations oi Bacon. The main principle oi Locke's Essay,
namely that all our ideas are derived from either sensation or reilec·
tion, appears to me to be contained in germ in the rst Aphorism
oi the Novum Organum, while to the attentive reader there can be
‘ no doubt that his whole mode oi treating psychological questions is
thoroughly imbued with the spirit oi Bacon's method. Itis true that
Iocke does not mention Bacon⁷‚ but, as I shall point out hereaiter‚
the frequent citation oi authors' names was not a fashion oi that
time. Though the whole os the Essay might not improperly be
regarded as a polemio against the philosophy oi Descartes, it is only
very seldom that Locke refers to him by name. Again, I think it
would be very difficult ior any one, aster careiully reading the yth
Book of the De Augmentis and alter tracing the obvious applica·
tione oi Bacon's principles and method to the scienoe ol conduct,
to resist the conclusion that his speculations and, perhaps still more,
his methodos investigation are, to a large extent, the source oi that
great school of moral philosophy which, numbering men so widely
divergent in many respecta as Hobbes and cumberland, Butler and
Bentham, agrees in basing the rules oi conduct on an inductiva
examination of the principles of human nature and the consequences
oi human actions English philosophy, or, at least, iar the larger
portion of it, seems to me to be thoroughly Baconian in its mma,
in its spirit. and in its method. In the eyes oi many this may be
areproach, but, if it be true as a fact, it will go far towards estab-
lishing a conclusion as to the influence oi Bacon over, at least,
one large department of investigation.

'There is avery probable allusion to Bacon in the discussion on syllogism,
which occurs in the chapter on Reason (bk. iv. ch. 17): ‘And therefore Syllogism
has been thought more proper ior the attaining Victory in Dispnte, than lor the
Discovery or Confirmation os Truth in iair enquiries' Cp.. amongst other pas·
sagea. Now. Org. i. 13, ‘Assensum itaque constringit, non res' The nent clause,
‘And is it be certain that Fallacy can be couched in Syllogisms, as it cannot
be denied, it must be something else, and not Syllogisrn, that must discover them,'
corresponds with Bacon's ircqnent pleas ior ι new Logic which shall test the ‘prin-
cipia scientiarum· thentselres.
