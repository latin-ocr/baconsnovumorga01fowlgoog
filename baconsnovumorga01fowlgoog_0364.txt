Qui causam alicujus naturae (veluti albedinis aut caloris) in
certis ¹⁷ tantum subjectis novit3 ejus scientia imperfecta est:
et qui effectum super certas tantum materias (inter eas, quae
sunt susceptibiles) inducere potest; ejus potentia pariter im-
perfecta est. At qui efficientem et materialem causam18 tan-
tummodo novit (quae causae fluxae sunt, et nihil aliud quam
vehicula et causae formam deferentes in aliquibusm), is ad
nova inventa, in materia aliquatenus simili et praeparata, per·
venire potest; sed rerum terminos altius fixos non movet.
At qui formas novit, is naturae unitatem in materiis dissi-
millimis complectitur²⁰; itaque quae adhuc facta non sunt,
qualia nec naturae vicissitudines, neque experimentales indus·
triae, neque casus ipse, in actum unquam perduxissent, neque

allusion would then be to the several differentiae which constitute, or
the several conditions out of which is produced, the given nature, such,
tor instance, as those enumerated in Aph. 20.

lt will be noticed that Bacon here employs the word ‘F orm' in a
different sense (namely, the signification appropriated to it by himself) from
thatin which he employed it in the last sentence but one, where he con·
demned the position assigned to Forms.

¹⁷ ‘Certain’ in the sense of ‘ particular!

¹⁸ The Efficient and Material Causes seem here to be spoken of only in
reference to concrete substances, while the Forms which Bacon basin
view in this Aphorism are those of ‘simple natures,' such as beat or
whlteness. Now he who lrnows the material and efficient causes of any
given substance may be able to produce or modify other substances of
asimilar character, but his power will extend no further. But he, on the
other hand, who is acquainted with the form, law, or cause of a ‘simple
nature,' such as beat or whiteness, will be able to produce it in substances
of the most dissimilar kind.

¹⁹ ln particular substances only. The meaning is that the Efficient and
Material Causes vary as we pass from oue substance to another (fluxae
sunt), and convey or embody the foma in certain cases only. ln other
cases,a different efficient cause might be necessary to convey, ora dif-
ferent material cause to embody, the same form.

²⁰ Thus, it we knew the Law of the development of Heat, we should be
able to produce heat in any substance whatever. This scientilic knowledge
of law is here contrasted with the merely empirical knowledge of the
artisan, who, being acquainted with certain substances only, can produce
changes in them, or like substances, but who, not being acquainted with
the Laws of Nature, cannot extend his operations beyond the range ot'

his experience.
