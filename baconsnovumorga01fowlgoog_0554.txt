geneorum inter se coeundi et se uniendi ⁷⁸. Differt autem'
iste motus a motu indigentiae, in duobus. Uno, quod in
motu indigentiae sit stimulus major naturae malignae et
contrariae3 at in hoc motu (si modo impedimenta et vincula
absint) uniuntur partes per amicitiam, licet absit natura¹ aliena
quae litem moveat: altero, quod arctior sit unio, et tanquam
majore cum delectu. In illo'enim‚ modo evitetur corpus inimi·
cum ⁷⁹, corpora etiam non admodum cognata ¹concurrunt3 at in

ε hoc codunt substantiae, germana plane similitudine devinctae,
z et conflantur tanquam in unum. Atque hic motus omnibus

corporibus compositis inest; et se facile conspiciendum in

[ς singulis daret, nisi ligaretur et fraenaretur per alios corporum

appetitus et necessitates, quae istam coitionem disturbant.
Ligatur autem motus iste plerumque tribus modis: torpore
corporum ; fraeno corporis dominantis; et motu externo. Ad

l torporem corporum quod attinet; certum est inesse corporibus

tangibilibus pigritiam quandam⁸⁰ secundum magis et minus, et
exhorrentiam motus localis3 ut, nisi excitentur, malint statu

'¹⁸ An excellent illustration of Baeon’s meaning may be found in the

“·’ commonly received opinion with regard to the formation of flint nodules.

ι See Phillips’ Manual of Geology, pp. 3 58-9‚ or Page’s lldvanced Text Book
2 of Geology‚ oth Ed„ pp. 3 50-4. The latter author discusses the question
at some length, and concludes: ‘From these facts it would seem that flints

⁵ are aggregatione of silex round some organic nucleus, just lile the ironstone

septaria of the coal-shales‚ the grains of the oolite, the ironstone nodules of

ζ the gault-all of which are aggregations round some organic centro, be it a
. fragment of plant,a stell, a tooth, coprolite, or other organism. This is

now the generally received opinion; and when it is remembered that the
organisms must have been deposited when the chalh was in a flocculent

and pulpy state, there can be little difficulty in conceiving how the silex,
¹ held iu solution by the waters of deposit, would, by chemical affinity,

attach itself to the decaying organism! Dr. Bowerbanlr appliesa similar

’ theory eveu to beds of tabular llint, supposing that the sponges originating

the deposit had developed themselves laterally, and that, approaching and

³ touching each other, they united and thus formed extensive and coutinuous
beds. On the formation of nodules generally, see also Lyell’s Student's
¹ Elements of Geology, and Ed, p. 4ο.

²⁹ As we have seen under ‘Motus sextus: this idea of the ‘corpus inimi·

¹ cum’ is, in many cases, fanciful.

⁸⁰ This is the property of inertia, and it is worth uoting that Bacon ’

’ refers to it; but it must be remembered that this property, as we con·

ceive it, applies equally to moving bodies, which would go on moving for

J ever, if there were nothing externa} to stop them.
