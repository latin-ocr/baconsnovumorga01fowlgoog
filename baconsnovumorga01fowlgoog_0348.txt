Etiam dubitabit quispiam potiusquam objiciet, utrum nos

⁵⁷ lt will be noticed that Natural Philosophy is bere used in its restricted
sense, as opposed to ‘scientiae logicae, ethicae,' δια, not as including the
consideration oi ‘affectus et prehensiones intellectuales! Cp. Aphs. 79, 80,
where it is used in the wider sense.

⁸⁸ Cp. Newton's Optics‚ blr. ii. ad lin: ‘And if Natural Philosophy in all
its parts, by pursuing this method, should at length be perfected, the
bounds of Moral Philosophy will be also erilarged. For so iar as we
can know by Natural Philosophy what is the First Cause, what power he
has over us, and what benelits we receive from him; so far our duty
towards him, as well as that towards one another, will appear to us by the
light of N ature!

This Aphorism, notwithstanding certain passages in the Novum Organum
which apparently point to the opposite conclusion, as, for instance, in the
Preface‚ p. 183, and in Aphs. 29, 77, 128, affords conclusive evidence that
Bacon contemplated the application of his method to the mental and
· moral, as well as the natural scientes. The extended meaning of the
term ‘Natural Philosophy' (including ‘affectus et prehensiones intellec·
tuales '), as employed ln Aph. 80, appears to imply the same intention.
And, though, perhaps there is nothing in Bacon’s worlrs strictly cor-
responding to the ‘historia et tabulae inveniendi de ira, metu,’ δια, of
which he speaks below, there are many places where he seems to assume
that such enquiries sall within the scope of his philosophy. Besides the
numerous passages in the later books of the De Augmentis‚ the student
may refer to the Novum Organum, Bk. ii. Aphs. 26, 27, 35 ad lin, Historia
Vitae et Mortis (E. and S., vol. ii. pp. ayo-174), Pilum Labyrinthi‚ sive
Inquisitio Legitima de Motu, ad fin. (E. and S., vol. iii. pp. figo-40),
Sylva Sylvarum, Exp. 795 and several of the ‘experiments’ in the tenth
century. But, without multiplying references, l rnay state that it appears
to me unquestionable that Bacon, while he regarded his method as
primarily, and, perhaps most easily applicable to the natural sciences,
contemplated its ultimate extension to all branches of knowledge alihe.
The passages which seem to point in the opposite direction, are, l con·
ceive, as l have already stated, ironical, and refer not to science, or know-
ledge in the true sense, at all, but to rhetoric and disputation.

On the justness of Bacon’s view and ou the sense or senses in which
Induction is applicable to the moral and mental sciences, this is not the
place to speak. lt may suffice to say that, in my opinion, certainty can
