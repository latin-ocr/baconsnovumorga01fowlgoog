naturam datam ex sonte aliquo essentiae deducat quae inest
pluribus, et notior est naturae ²⁹ (ut loquuntur) quarn ipsa
forma. Itaque de axiomate vero et perfecto sciendi pronun·
tiatum et praeceptum tale est; ut inveniatur natura alio, quae
sit cum natura data convertibilis ³⁰, et tomen sit limitatio no·

V.

At praeceptum sive axioma de transformatione corporum
duplicis est generis ³³. Primum intuetur corpus, ut turmam

data is developed from the menstruum, or, which is only another way
of speaking, as the laco oi the process by which the menstruum is con·
verted into the natura data.

²⁹ That is, more general. See note ²7 on Bk. i. nph. aa. The proper
expression is natura notior. ·

³⁰ This expression requires qualification. See notes 25, 26 above.

³¹ ‘As of a true genus! The ‘genus verum ' is the same as the ‘natura
notius' or ‘fons essentiae!

³² See Blr. i. Aphs. 81, 129, with the notes.

⁸³ One of these modes of transformation proceeds by discovering the
various simple natures or qualities which determine the character of the
body, and then superinducing them one by one, till the body is constituted
(cp. Sylva sylvarum, Exp. 328); the other watches the latent process by
which the body is produced according to the ordinary way of nature, and
then attempts to repeat it artificially. The artificial productiori of marble
by fusion under pressure would be a good instance of the latter mode
of transformation, as well as the various attempts, more or less successful,
to produce artificial diamonds. For Bacon's sanguine expectations as
to the former mode, l cannot offer a better apology than that suggested
by Mr. Mill (Loglc‚ blr. v. ch. 3. §ylr ‘Why should it not be possible
to make goldl Each of the characteristic properties of gold has its forma,
its essence, its set of conditions, which if we could discover, and learn how
to realise, we could superinduce that particular property upon any other
substance, upon wood, or iron, or lime, or clay. lf, then, we could effect
this with respect to every one of the essential properties oi the precious
metal, we should have converted the other substance lntogold. Nor did
this, if once the premises were granted, appear to transcend the real
powers of mankind. For daily experience showed that almost every one
oi the distinctive sensible properties of any object, its consistence, its
colour, its taste, its smell, its shape, admitted of being totally changed
by fire, or water, or some other chemical agent. The formae of all those

qualities seeming, therefore, to be within human power either to produce
