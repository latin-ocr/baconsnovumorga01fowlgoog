LXIX.

At pravae demonstrationes idolorum veluti munitiones.
quaedam sunt et praesidia⁰³3 eaeque, quas in dialecticis
habemus, id fere agunt, ut mundum plane cogitationibus
humanis, cogitationes autem verbis addicant et mancipent ⁶⁴.
Demonstrationes vero potentia quadam⁶⁵ philosophiae ipsae
sunt et scientiae. Quales enirn eae sunt, ac prout rite aut
male institutae, tales sequuntur philosophiae et contempla-
tiones. Fallunt autem et incompetentes sunt eae quibus
utimur in universo illo processu, qui a sensu et rebus ducit ad
axiomata et conclusiones. Qui quidem processus quadru-
plex ⁶⁶ est, et vitia ejus totidem. Primo, impressiones sensus

ω lt would seem from this passage as if the ‘pravae demonstrationes'
were to be discussed as supplementa! to the ‘idola' But they are thern·
selves (see Aph. 61) a subdivision of the ‘idola theatri,’ which originate ‘ ex
fabulis theoriarum et perversis legibus demonstrationum!

⁰⁴ This is a good example of the pregnancy and suggestiveness of many
of Bacon's sayings. lt is singularly applicabis to many metaphysical
systems, both ancient and modern. Men, neglectius the facts of nature
and mind, often attempt to construet an a priori system of the universe,
‘enslaving the world to their own thoughts,’ while their thoughts them·
selves are concealed and lettered in the meshes of a technical terminology.

Cp. De Principiis atque Originibus, secundum fabulas Cupidinis et Coeli
(E. and S., vol. iii. pp. 85-6) ι ‘ ltaque hi omnes' (Empedocles, Anaxagoras,
dcc.) ‘mentem rebus submiserunt. At Plato mundum cogitationibus,
Aristoteles vero etiam cogitationes verbis, adjudicarunt!

⁸⁵ Thus, for instance, the failure of the ancients ln the Physical Sciences
is due largely to their disproportionate employment of the Deductive
method. Their success, on the other hand, in some branches of Mathe·
matics was due to the extent to which this method had been already
elaborated.

Again, it has often been remarked that fundamental differences in opinion
generally turn on fundamental differences in method. Thus, the method
of Locke, which is mainly inductive, and the method of Descartes, which is
mainly a priori, result in two widely different systems of mental philosophy.
The introspective method of Butler and the historical method of Hume,
again, though both of them essentially inductive, lead to very divergent
theories of ethics. The position, in fact, might beillustrated to almost any
extent in the history of either ancient or modern philosophy.

⁶⁶ Bacou points out four respects in which the present methods of
demonstration are defective:

(r) The seuses frequently fail or deceive us;
(a) Our notious are confused and ill-defined;
