tus3 odor venaticus in canibus, inter genera olfactus. Etiam S
litera apud grammaticos, habetur pro monodica3 ob facilem
compositionem quam sustinet curn consonantibus, aliquando
duplicibus, aliquando triplicibus ¹3 quod nulla alia litera facit.
Plurimi autem faciendae sunt hujusmodi instantiae; quia
acuunt et vivificant inquisitionem, et medentur intellectui
depravato a consuetudine et abiis quae fiunt plerunque.

XXIX

Inter praerogativas instantiarum, ponemus loco octavo
Instantias Devo'antes²,· errores scilicet naturae, et vaga, ac
monstra: ubi natura declinat et deflectit a cursu ordinario
Differunt enim errores naturae ab instantiis monodicis in hoc3
quod monodicae sint miracula specierum, at errores sint
miracula individuorum. Similis autern fere sunt usus3 quia
rectificant intellectum adversus consueta, et revelant formas
communes. Neque enim in his etiam desistendum ab in·
quisitione donec inveniatur causa hujusmodi declinationis³.
Veruntamen causa illa non exurgit ad formam aliquam
proprie, sed tantum ad latentem processum ad [formamh
Qui enim vias naturae noverit, is deviationes etiam facilius

¹ An instance of the former case is to be found in the English word
‘strap,’ of the latterin the German word ‘ schwarz.’

¹ Mr. Kitchin truly remarks that ‘instantes 7, 8, and 9 might have all
corne under one head, for Mono[o]diaae in Species are what Deviantes are in
lndividuals, and Limiraneae are offshoots of Mono[a]dicae, being those cases
in which two species seem to have transgressed one another's limits.'
Satum’s rings‚ the perturbations of the planet Uranus, and the red flames
which accompany a total eclipse of the Suu would fall under the head
of instantiae Deviantes.

⁸ An admirable instance of an enquiry of this kind is that which led to
the discovery of the planet Neptune, in consequence of the observed
perturbations of Uranus.

⁴ The meaning of this remark is not very obvious. For a true ea·
planation of these ‘monstra’ ought to throw light on the nature of the
species to which they belong. What Bacon had in mind probably was
that ‘deviating instancss’ are due to some arrest or modification of the
process which would ordinarily result in the more usual form, and, hence,
that their explanation throws light, not directly on the form, but on'
the process which leads to the form. ludirectly, however, it would illus·
trate the nature or form as well.
