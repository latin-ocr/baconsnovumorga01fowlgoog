⁸⁸ lt is true that the higher we ascend in the atmosphere, the colder it
, is, aud the lower we descend into the interior ol the earth, the warmer
it is; but these two sets of facts depend on different causes, and hence
they do not really constitute an Instantia Conlormis.

On the internal heat ol the earth and the causes of volcanoes and earth·
quakes, see Lyell's Principles of Geology, chs. ou the Causes of Earin-
quakes and Volcanoes (rath Ed, chs. 32, 33).

⁹⁴ Cp. ii. ra. lnst. ²4· The word ἀντιπερίστασις is of not uncommon
occurrence in Aristotle. See, for instance, Physics¹ viil. ιο (p. 267 a. 16):
διὸ καὶ r'w ἀέρι καὶ ἐν ὕδατι γίνετοιὴ τοιαύτη κίνησις, ἣν λέγουσι’ τινες ἀνη-
περίστοσιν εἶναι. Meteorologica, l. ra (p. 348 b. al: ἀλλ’ ἐπειδὴ ὁρῶμεν ὅτι
γίνεται ἀντιπερίστασις τῷ θερμῷ rol τῷ ψυχρῷ ἀλλήλοις. On the former
passage, Bonitz quotes the following delinition from Simplicius: ἀντι·
, περίστοσὶς ἔστιν, ὅταν ἐξωθουμένου τινὸς σώματος ἀπαλλαγὴ γίνηται τῶν
τόπον, καὶ τὸ μὲν ἕξοθῆσον ἕν τῷ τοῦ ἰξοθηθέντοο στῇ τοπῷ, τὸ δ’ ε’ξοθηθέν τὸ
προσεχὲς ἐξωθῇ, ἕως ἃν τὸ ἔσχατον ἐν τῷ τόπῳ γένηται τοῦ πρότου ignotissimos.

⁹³ These are the ‘Axiomata quae particularium scientiarum non sint
propria, sed pluribus earum incommune competant’ which constitute one
division ol the Philosophia Prima. See De Augmentis, iii. 1. Aristotle
employs the word ἀξιώματα iu a similar, though not exactly the same sense,
lor the principles common to all sciences. See note on i. 7.

⁹⁵ ‘ Is not the trope ol music, to avoid or slide from the close or cadence‚
common with the trope ol rhetoric of deceiving expectationi ⁹ advance·
ment of Learning, bk. ii. (E. and S, vol. iii. pp. 348-9). ‘Tropus ille
Musteus, a clausula aut cadentia (quarn vocant), curn J'amjam adesse videatur,
placide elabendi, convenit curn tropo Rhetorice expectationem eludendi.'
De Augm. iii. 1. The following note, communicated by Professor Sir F.
A. Gore Ouseley, l borrow from Mr. Kitchin: ‘At first I thought it meant
a “ Cadenza d' luganno,” or “salse cadence;” but 1 have now satisfied
mysell that such a thing was unknown in Bacon's time. l am rather
inclined to think it refers to a species ol false close, such as we lind in the
last bar but two ol Tallis's Nunc Dimittis in D, where the Harmony pro·

ceeds to ff and ,ζ on Α lor a Bass, as though it were about to close

immediately on the chord oi D; when suddenly the Tenor strikes a Ch,
which necessitates a modulation into the chord of G, thus leading to a

“ Plagal Close.''’
*⁹⁰ Generally, and more properly called an Axiom.
