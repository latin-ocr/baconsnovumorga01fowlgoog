ii. 48 (a), we must, l think, notwithstanding the expressions of doubt in
the present passage, regard him as having deliberately rejected the doctrine
ola vacuum.

⁶²1 borrow the following note from Ellis and Spedding's Edition:
“‘Vaeuum permistum,” κενὸν ἀχώριστον, is vacuum diffused through the
interstices of any portion ot matter. By “vacuum coacervatum‚” κενὸν
κεχωρισμένον, is meant clear empty space. See, sor this distinction,
Aristode, Phys. iv. 7 [p. ²14]· Hero of Alexandria, whom Bacon mentions
more than once, approves of those who admit the former ltind oi vacuum
and reject the latter. See the Introduction to his spiritalia.

‘[lt is perhaps worth observing that in the fable entitled “Cupido sive
lltomus ’' (De Sap. Vet. xvii), where the theory of a vacuum is mentioned,
this distinction was not introduced till Bacon revised the work in his later
years. The passage which stands thus in the original edition (1609)-
“ Qisquis autem atomum ponit et vacuum, necessario virtutem atomi ad
distans introducit ’'——is altered, in the edition publlshed by Rawley after
Bacon's death, to “Qtisquis autem atomum asserit atque vacuum (licet
istud vacuum intermistum ponat, non segregatum) necessario,” dcc.—
J. S.]'

Cp. the similar distinction of ‘aer permistus’ and ‘aer coacervatus’ in
Aph. 50 ad init.

⁸³ For this and other reasons, see Arist. Phys. iv. 6 (p. ²13 b).

⁸⁴ Cp.Historia Densi et Rari, E. and S.,vol.ii.p. 303: ‘lnter terminos densi
et rari est plica materiae, perquam se complicat et replicat absque vacuo!

Pllca (from plico) is explained by Du Cange as ‘plicatura vel involutio!

⁸⁶ ‘Nor is there in air two thousand times more of vaculty than ln gold!
ln li. go, he states the density of gold at 21 times that of spirits of wine,
and that of spirits of wn'ne at roo times that of its own vapour; while
in the Historia Densi et Rari (E. and S., vol. ii. p. 255), he says that
all fumes are rarer than air. This would make tbe density of gold more
than 2100 times greater than that ol air, or, speaking roughly, 2000 times
greater. Bacon, who was not much of a mathematician, probably took
for granted that the ratio of the amounts of vacuity, contained in equal
weights ol the two bodies, was inversely that of the densltles. But this is
plainly not the case.

Proeeeding on a calculation based on passages in the Historia Densi
et Rari only, Mr. Ellis males the supposed density ol gold 1900-t01d that
