similiter, et multo magia, super phaenomena philosophiae fun·
dari possunt et constitui varia dogmata. Atque hujusmodi

theatri fabulae habent etiam illud, quod in theatro poetarum
usu venit; ut narrationes fictae ad scenam narrationibus ex
historia veris concinniores sint et elegantiores, et quales quis
magis vellet.

In genere autem, in materiam philosophiae sumitur aut
multum ex paucis, aut parum ex multis¹³3 ut utrinque
philosophia super experientiae et naturalis historiae ¹nimis
angustam ¹⁴ basin fundata sit, atque ex paucioribus quam par

experientia arripiunt varia et vulgaria, eaque neque certo

¹⁸ ‘Multum ex paucis’ evidently refers to the Empirical School. as
described below and in many other passages, and, consequently, ‘parum ex
multis’ must refer to the Rational or Sophistic School. But its meaning,
as referred to this school, is not obvious, the charge against it usually being
that it founds propositione of too wide a degree oi generality on too
slender a basis of fact. Can the phrase mean that the first inferences
drawn by the Rational School, instead of being true ‘axiomata minime
generalia' and therefore just covering the facts and no more, are of too
vague and generala character, being based on a cursory view of a great
number of facts, to be of any service with respect to subsequent in-
ductions? Th'e whole passage might then be paraphrased as follows:
‘The Empirical School examines minutely a small number of facts, and
bases far too many inferences upon them; the Rational or Sophistic
School examines cursorily a large number of facts, and infers from them
too few conclusions, while those conclusions are of so vague a character as
to be practically useless! lt must be remembered that the ‘axiomata
minime generalia‚’ or Jirsr inferences from the facts, would, according
to Bacon's ideal, be very numerous, and would furnish the basis for

subsequent inductions of various degrees.

¹⁴ ln the first case, the basis of facts is too small; in the second case,
the ‘axiomata minime generalia‚’ from which subsequent axioms are to be
inferred, are too few.

¹³ Called below ‘Sophistic' This division of philosophers trusts too
much to mere reasoning‚ as the next trusts too much to mere experience.
