which appeared in the time of Claudius and Nero, and sums up his own
opinion as follows: ‘Ego nostris non adsentior: non enirn existimo
cometen subitaneum ignem, sed inter aeterna opera naturae.’ (Chaps. 21,
aa.) Α view somewhat similar to the former was regarded as possible
even by Galileo. See ll Saggiatore, 20⁰, dc, where he defends, as a pos·
sible explanation of comets, the theory that they are formed by exhalations
from the earth, rising to a great height and reflecting the light of the Sun.
The return of Halley’s Comet, nearly at the time predicted by him, in
17 59, conclusively proved that these bodies belong to the solar, and not to
the terrestrial system, and that, in the words of Seneca, they are ‘aeterna
opera naturae!

⁸⁶ Neither the one effect nor the other, so far as 1 am aware, has ever
been established by meteorological observation. nt the same time, it
would be rash to deny that comets might have either or both of these
ellects, especially if it be true, as the most recent spectrum analysis seems
to shew, that ‘the nucleus is sels-luminous, and that it is very possibly
composed of glowing gas containing carbon! See a most interesting
section on Comets and their spectra in Dr. Schellen's spectrum Analysis,
transpated by J. and C. Lassell, and edited by Dr. Huggins (Longulam,
1872.

⁸⁶ For ‘trabes' see Seneca’s Natural Qestions‚ i. r, vii. 4, 53 for
‘columnae flagrantes,’ vii. 203 and for ‘chrismata' i. 14. As ΜΓ. Kitchin
observes, they are all ol thern clearly names for different appearances of
the Aurora Borealis, unless we suppose that ‘columnae clipeique flagrantes'
may stand for the Zodiacal Light.

⁸² This is not quite accurate. The annual maxima of these appearances
are, taking an average, in March and October, the latter being the greater;
and the annual minima in June and January. Whether the Aurora be an
electrical phenomenon (as most meteorologists suppose), or whether (as
some suppose) it be a cloud of meteoric dust ignited by friction with the
atmosphere, there is nothing to connect it with the rate of temperatum.

lt is, of course, only on clear nights that the phenomenon can be seen,
and such nights are generally cold.

'⁸ This is generally, though not universally, true. As aerial electricity is,
in all probability, mainly due to evaporation, and this takes place toa
much greater extent in hot weather than in cold, there isa good reason
why inundet-storms should be more frequent in summer than in winter.
