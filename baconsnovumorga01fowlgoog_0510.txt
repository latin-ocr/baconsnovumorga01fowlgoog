s 1) In primo genere non fit deductio ad sensibile, nisi rei,
quae cerni non possit propter distantiam, adjiciatur aut
substituatur alia res quae sensum magise longinquo provocare
et ferire possit: veluti in significatione rerum per ignes,
campanas et similia ⁴⁵.

(a) In secundo genere fit deducti0, cumea quae interius
propter interpositionem corporum latent, nec commode aperiri
possunt, per ea quae sunt in superficie, aut ab interioribus
effluunt, perducuntur ad sensum: ut status humanorum
corporum per pulsus, et urinas, et similia ⁴⁶.

(3, 4) At tertii et quarti generis ⁴⁷ deductiones ad plurima
spectant, atque undique in rerum inquisitione sunt conqui-
rendae. Hujus rei exempla sunt. Patet quod aer, et spiritus,
et hujusmodi res quae sunt toto corpore tenues et subtiles,
nec cerni nec tangi possint. Quare in inquisitione circa
hujusmodi corpora deductionibus omnino est opus.

Sit itaque natura inquisita Actio et Motus Spiritus qui
includitur in corporibus tangibilibus⁴⁸. Omne enim tangibile

theories, doubtless suggested by it, which have been applied in recent times
to the elucidation oi some of the more obscure problems of psychology.

⁴⁶ A ‘glaring instance* will, os course, suggest itself in the Electric
Telegraph.

‘⁸ Mr. Kitchin instances the Stethescope.

‘Au excellent instance of the “deductio non-sensibilis ad sensibile ’¹
occurs in the experimenta recently made by Messrs. Hopkins and Juule
sor determining the melting·point of substances subjected to great pres-
sure. The substance acted on is enclosed in a tube out of reach and sight.
But abit of magnetised steel has previously been introduced into it, and is
supported by it as long as it remaius solid. Amagnetic needle is placed
beside the apparatus, a certain amount of deviatiou being, of course, pro·
duced by the steel within the tube. The moment the temperature reaches
the melting-point, the steel sinks3 and its doing so is indicated by the
motion of the needle.' Mr. Ellis' note.

⁴⁷ Of the third kind Mr. Kitchin gives good instances in the chemical
detection of gases, and the discovery of Actinism in rays of the sun by
exposure ol a plate ol silver to them, The microscope (see note 43
above) is not an appropriate instance of the fourth kind But vve might
find a good instance in the thermometer (which Bacon himself gives), or a
still better one in the thermo-electric pile, as indicaring small accessions ol
temperature, inappreciable to the senses. Tests of all kinds, as Bacon
observes, sall under one or other ol these heads.

stantly recurs also in his other works to the idea oi ‘spirit’ its various
