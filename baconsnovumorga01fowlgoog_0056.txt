’01 the earth’s motion never, before the time of Galileo, even con·

ceived this law, never proposed it. and of course never proved it’
Itis possible to draw up a long list of eminent men, astronomers

and others, anterior to 01 contemporary with Bacon, who adopted
and taught the Copernican theory. Such were Rheticus, Reinhold,
author of the Prutenic tables (who, however, according to Delambre“,
simply made use of the observations of Copernicus for the purpose 01
construeting tables, and gave 30 opinion as to the motion of either
the earth 01 the sun), Peter Ramus, Francis Patrizi (Patricius),
Glordano Bruno, Thomas Digges, William Gilbert¹ Maestlin (wh0,
however, seems to have been mainlya mathematical Copernican), and,
lastly, Kepler and Galileo themselves. But of these, some, like
Patricius, Bruno, and Ramus, do not seem to have had any very
good reasons for their opinions. Others, like Gilbert n, to whom we
may add Patricius, only admitted the diurnal motion of the earth,
and may therefore be claimed by either side. And against this list
we may put the great name 01 Tycho Β13116” (who, however,
having died in 1601, did not live to become acquainted with the dis·

coveries of Galileo), Vieta, the greatest French mathematician os the
sixteenth century, as De Morgan calls him, Cluvius, the learned Jesuit,

probably Edward Wright, and possibly, from his silence, even Stevinus.
Amongst the latest of the Anti-Copemicans were Thomas Lydiat, who
died in 1646, and Riccioli, who in his Almagestum Novum, published
as late as 1651, enumerated, according to Whewell ⁸⁰, fifty-seven
Copernican arguments, and pretended to refute thern all.

The list of Anti-Copemicans, respectable as it is, is not, it must
be aclrnowledged, equal in reputation to that of the Copernicans, but
then posterity, it must be recollected, is always lrinder to the winning
than to the losing side. And even of the Copernicans, as we have
seen, some went only half way, while others, probably, did not feel
