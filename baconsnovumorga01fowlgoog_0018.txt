But what is more remarkable than individual passages is

the general influence os Bacon’s writings on the tone and '

thoughts oi this author.

ln note 6 on p. 231, I have inadvertently spoken of the
‘primum mobile' as the ‘outermost sphere oi the Universe,'
whereas 1 should have said that it is the first or outermost os
the ‘moveable sphereS,' these being distinguished from the
fixed sphere, or empyrean heaven, which was supposed to be
illimitable in extent, and to encircle all the others.

lt has been pointed out to me by my relative, Mr. James
Fowler of Wakefield, that in the work of Athanasius Kircher,
Magnes sive De Arte Magnetica (first published at Rome
in 1641), there is a list oi ‘Axiomata seu Pronuntiata De
Natura et Arte,’ in which the maxims ‘Homo naturae minister
et Interpres tantum iacit, quantum e naturae ordine re vel
mente observarit’ (I. 1), ‘Natura non nisi parendo vincitur;
vincitur autem cum,' &c (Ι. 3), ‘Ad opera externa nihil aliud
potest homo, quam ut corpora naturalia admoveat, et amoveat,
natura intus transigente' (Ι. 4), and ‘qui formas rerum novit,
is unitatem in materiis dissimillimis complectitur’ (ΙΙ. 3), are
referred respectively to Pythagoras, Synesius, Maimonides,
and Averroes. The last of these maxims is likely enough
to bea common-place, and I have made no effort to verify
the quotation, but Ι have searched in vain sor the three
former. The first is certainly not included in any oi the
sayings attributed to Pythagoras or the Pythagoream, with
which I am acquainted. From the fact that Kircher (who
was a Jesuit‚ and published his work at Rome) gives these
maxims in almost the very words and the very sequence oi

words of Bacon‚ and, moreover, arranges them in the very ¹

order in which they occur in the Novum Organum, I am
Inclined to suspect that he did some violence to the pas·

sages he had in mind, in order to throw discredit on the
English philosopher.
