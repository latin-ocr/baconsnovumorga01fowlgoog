hac certe forma inductionis aliquatenus utitur. Verum ad
hujus inductionis, sive demonstrationis ⁴, instructionem bonam
et legitimam quamplurima adhibenda sunt, quae adhue nullius
mortalium cogitationem subiere3 adeo ut in ea major sit con-
sumenda opera, quam adhuc consumpta est in syllogismo ⁵.

Atque hujus inductionis auxilio, non solum ad axiomata
invenienda, verum etiam ad notiones terminandas ⁶, utendum
est· Atque in hac certe inductione spes maxima sita est.

At in axiomatibus constituendis per hanc inductionem,
examinatio et probatio etiarn iacienda est, utrum quod con·
stituitur axioma aptatum sit tantum et ad mensuram sactum
eorum particularium exquibus extrahitur3 an vero sit am-
plius et latius⁷. Quod si sit amplius aut latina, videndum
an eam suam amplitudinem et latitudinem per novorum
particularium designationem, quasi fide-jussione quadam,
firmet⁸; nevel in jam notis tantum haereamus, vel laxiore

=notiones, was, before the time of David Buchanan and Descartes, ex-
ceedingly rare. See Hamilton on Reid, Appendix, Note G, where the
student will find a most interesting account ol the history oi the word.
ln Aph. 23 and elsewhere, Bacon uses it in its scholastic sense, as appro-
priated to the forms of the Divine Mind, ‘divinae mentis ideae! See note
29 on Aph. 23.

⁴ Bacon probably uses this term, usually appropriated to mathematical
proof, of set purpose. He conceived, and conceived, l thinlr, rightly, that
Induction, if properly conducted, is capable of affording evidence positively
certain.

⁶ Any one acquaiuted with the subsequent history of scientific discovery
and scientific method will admire the wonderful foresight displayed by
Bacon in this sentence. Ι

⁶ Thus, lor instance, ii we arrive at a true axiom on the nature of beat,
we shall be better able to detine the term or notion. Cp. Aph. 14 aud
note 17.

Ἰ Cp. Aph. 70 and note 72. We bere again come across the distinction
since expressed by the terms ‘ Empirical Law' and ‘ Law of Nature!

⁸ Mr. Adamson (Eucyclopaedla Britannica, vol. iii. p. 217) is quite right
in saying that this Aphorism appears to introduce the idea of hypothesis.
He might also have added that it introduces the idea oi velification,
including prediction. hs to the nature of tbe ‘fidejussi0,' l may remark
that the circumstance of a scientific generalisation enabling us to
predict the future affords a strong confirmation of its truth, though
