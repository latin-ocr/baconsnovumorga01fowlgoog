INTRODUCTION. 121

mightily extolled by speculative men; that while all admired the
sublime geometry which shone throughout his work, few for some
time appeared to be disposed to hearken to his philosophy, or in a
condition to judge of it impartially. However, Lord Bacon's ex·
hortations and example had a good effect3 and experimental philo·
sophy has been much more cultivated since his time than in any
preceding period. Geometry and philosophy advanced together at
a great pace, and gave mutual aid to each other!

Though Newton’s worlts contain no direct reference to Bacon,
there are passages which make it very difficult to suppose that he
was not acquainted with, at least, the first book of the Novum
Organum either through his own reading or through the common
tradition of its teaching. Of the Regulae Philosophandi (contained
in Horsley's Edition of Newton's Worlrs, vol. iii. pp. 2-4), the third
has already been referred to in my extract from Pemberton. But,
for our present purpose, the fourth is still more to the point. It
runs as follows:

‘In Philosophia experimentali, Propositiones ex phaenomenis per
inductionem collectae, non obstantibus contrariis hypothesibus, pro
veris aut accurate, aut quam proxime, haberi debent, donec alia
occurrerint Phaenomeua, per quae aut accuratiores reddantur, aut
exceptionibus obnoxiae!

. ‘Hoc fieri debet. ne argumentum inductionis tollatur per hy·
potheses.'

This mle, both in substance and expression, is thoroughlyBaconian,
and, I venture to suggest, could hardly have been stated as it is by
any one not acquainted with the Baconian philosophy.

At the end of the third book of the Optics (Horsley's Ed, vol. iv.
pp. 263, 264), there is a longer and fuller passage, much to the same
effect:

‘As in Mathematicks, so in Natural Philosophy, the investigation
of difficult things by the method of analysis ³⁴, ought ever to precede
the method of composition. This analysis consists in malting ex·
periments and observations, and in drawing general conclusions from
them by induction, and admitting of no objections against the con· ·
clusions, but such as are taken from experimenta, or other certain
