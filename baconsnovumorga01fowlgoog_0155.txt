Under this head, I propose only to give some examples of the
various grounds ol opposition or disparagemeut to which the
Baconian philosophy has been subjected, thinking that, though sar
from exhaustive, they will be ol some interest to the reader.

Perhaps, I ought first to notice a letter from Sir Thomas Bodley
(originally published in Bacon's Remains, 1648, pp. 85-87), ‘to Sir
Francis Bacon, about his Cogitata et Visa, wherein he declareth his
opinion lreely touching the same! The wn'ter, who has evidentlya
great affection for the old learning, is somewhat scandalised by Bacon's
revolutionary sentiments, and thinks that it we ‘come babes ad
regnum naturae, as we are willed by Scriptures to come ad regnum
coelorum, there is nothing more certain than that it would instantly
bring us to Barbarism, and aster many thousand years leave us more
unprovided of theoricall sumiture than we are at this present! The
letter is interesting, but it betrays bewildenuent and an incapacity to
understand Bacon's dissatislaction with the existing state of things or
a reform in the sciences such as he projected. It has, in recent
times, been disinterred from oblivion by De Maistre and other
antagonists ol Bacon.

Far more pertinent is the uniavourable opinion ol Bacon's philo-
sophy expressed by Harvey, as given in Aubrey's Lives (Letters
written by Eminent Persons in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth
Centuries, to which are added Lives of Eminent Men by John
Aubrey Esq., 1813, vol. ii. p. 381): ‘He' (Harvey) ‘had been phy·
sician to the Lord Ch. Bacon, whom he esteemed much for his witt
and style, but would not allow him to be a great philosopher. Said
he to me, “ He writes philosophy like a Ld Chanceller,’' speaking
in derision! Harvey, however, seems to have had a peculiar dislihe
ol the ‘neoteriques’ to whom, we are told on p. 383, he once, in
