propter differentias impressionum, prout occurrunt in animo
praeoccupato et praedisposito, aut in animo aequo et sedato,
vel ejusmodi: ut plane spiritus humanus (prout disponitur‘
in hominibus singulis) sit res varia, et omnino perturbata, et

Sunt etiam idola tanquam ex contractu et societate humani
generis ad invicem, quae idola sor'r’54, propter hominum
commercium et consortium, appellamus. Homines enim
per sermones sociantur; at verba ex captu vulgi impo-
nuntur. Itaque mala et inepta verborum impositio miris
modis intellectum obsidet. Neque definitiones aut explica·

generaliter. . . . tum etiam cuique en educatione, studiis, et natura sua,
va quandam seductoriam et quasi daemonem familiarem adame, qui
mentem variis et vanis spectris ludat et turbet! lt may be noticed, by the
way, that the use of the word ‘spectra' as the equivalent of ‘idola,’ affords
a further proof, if any were wanted, of the sense in which Bacon employed
the latter word. Dr. Crailr, in proposIng to translate ‘idola’ as ‘ spectres,’
calls attention to a passage in Cicero’s Letters (Ad Fam. xv. 16), in which
Cicero observes that Catius, the Epicurean, who had lately died, had given
the name of spectra to what Epicurus himself, and, before him, Democritus
had called εἴδωλα.

⁵* The idols oi the marlret-place (or ‘ palace,’ Valerius Terminus) are so
called, because words (which are the ‘tesserae notionum,’ Aph. ¹4) are
the means by which men carry on their ordinary lntercourse in the affairs
of life. We exchange words as we enchange wnres in the market.

In addItIon to the sections on the fallacies arising from the ambiguous
use of terms, to be found in almost any treatise on Logic, the student
should read the third book of Loclre’s Essay, and especially chs. 9, 10, 11,
Dugald Stewart’s Philosophy of the Human Mind, pt. i. ch. 4, sects. 4, 5
with Note L, and pt. il. second subdivision, ch. i. (Of Language), sect. 3,
Mackintosh’s Dissertationon the Progress of Ethical Philosophy, Introduc-
tion, and Mr. Mill’s Logic, blr. iv. chs. 3·⁶·
