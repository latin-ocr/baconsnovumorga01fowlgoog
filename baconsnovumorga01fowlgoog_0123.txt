¹ 100 INTRODUCTION.

The second question is, to my mind, much more difficult to answer
than the first, though 1 can entertain no doubt that Bacon has exerted
a real and beneficial influence on the subsequent progress of science.
The extentos this influence, however, and its precise character'are
not easy to determine.

The best mode os proceeding, perhaps, is to lay before the reader‚
in chronological order, the testimonies to Bacon's influence and to the
value oi his metbod (the attacks or innuendos of his opponents are
noticed elsewhere), and then to attempt brielly to estimate the direc-
tion in which his influence was exerted and the value historically‚ as

bearing on the subsequent progress of science‚ of the rules and
maxims which he enforces.
