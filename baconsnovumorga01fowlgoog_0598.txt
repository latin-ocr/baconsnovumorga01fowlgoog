spectat3 scilicet cum corpus occurrens uni parti corporis

aut aliud regimen motus fit per extra3 sed etiam percorpus

” attribuit Telesius³¹ figuras animalium, ob rivulos scilicet et

l loculos matricis. Debuerat autem notare similem efforma-

· tionem in testis ovorum, ubi non sunt rugae aut inaequalitas.

ῑ Chemistry, as, for instance, the Clavis of Gerardus Domeus, F rancf. 1583,
; shew this instrument to have been in common use in Bacon’s time.

⁸¹ ‘Telesius's doctrine of the formation of the embryo is essentially the

, same as Galen's, namely that a system of arteries &c. must be first of all
⁵ formed in the germ, aud that these, by applying themselves to cor·
³ responding parts on the suriace of the matrix, determine the channels
3 through which nourlshment is supplied, and therefore (mediately) the

development of the different members of the foetus. But it does not
seem that he would have admitted that the smoothness of the shells
of eggs was an objection to his theory. At any rate, he illustrates it
by reference to the appearances presented by an egg opened during in-
cubation. De rerum natura, vi. chs. 4 and 4ο.’ Mr. Ellis’ note.

⁸² Mr. Ellis says: ‘The proper word for what we call a model is
“proplasma,” which is used in a Latin form by Pliny. l have not seen
any authority for such an adjective as “ proplasticus.” What Bacon means
is not exactly a model, buta mould for casting! ἸἸιε reference to Pliny
is Nat. Hist. xxxv. ιη (45), sect. 155. ln Cicero, Epist. ad Atticum,
xii. ⁴1, the word is written in Greek.

⁸³ Cp. i. 66, and note 47.

⁸⁴ The remarks which Bacon presently proceeds to male are alone
sufficient to shew how little right he had to complain of the fanciful views
entertained by others on this class of questions. On the same subject, cp.
Aditus ad Historiam Sympathiae et Antipathiae Rerum (E. and 8., vol. ii.
p. 81); Cogitata et Visa (E. and S, vol. iii. p. 606); Sylva Sylvarum, Exps.
95-973 and, on the kindred subject of Natural Magic, Nov. Org. ii. 9
ad fin, and ii. 31 ad sm, with the note on the latter passage, and the other
places there referred to.
