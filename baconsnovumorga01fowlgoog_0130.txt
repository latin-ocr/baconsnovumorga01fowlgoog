INTRODUCTION. ¹07

respondence with tvo distinguished Italian ecclesiastics, Father
Baranzan and Father Fulgentio Bacon's very interesting letter to the
former, who was a young professor of mathematics and philosophy
at Annecy in Savoy, was preserved by J. P. Niceron in his marrones,
and is reprodnced by Mr. Spedding in his seventh volume of Bacon's
Life and Letters, pp. 374-378. Baranzan's letter, which called forth
this response, is unfortunately not extant. With Father Fulgentio,
who, according to Archbishop Tenison¹⁷, was ‘a Divine (if 1 mis-
take not) of the Republic of Venice, and the same who wrote
the Life of his Colleague, the excellent Father Paul,' passed at least
one interchange of letters. Here, again, the letter of Fulgentio is
unfortunately lost, but Bacon’s reply is given in Tenison’s Baconiana
(pp. 196-200), and in the seventh volume 01 Spedding's Life and
Letters of Bacon, pp. 531-533.

Attention'is drawn by Mr. Napier to a cutibus and interesting
letter from Toby Matthevr to Bacon, dated Brussels, April 4, 1619¹⁸,
in which he connects the name of Bacon with that ol Galileo. ‘It
may please your Lordship, there was with me this day one Mr.
Richard white, who hath spent some little time at Florence, and is
now gone into England. He tells me, that Galileo had ansvered
your discourse concerning the flux and reflux of the sea, and was
sending it unto me; but that Mr. White hindered him, because his
answer was grounded upon a false supposition, namely, that there ·
was in the ocean a full sea but once in twenty-four hours. But now
lwill call upon Galileo again! As the tract De Fluxu et Refluru
Maris was not published till it was included in Gruter's collection
of 1653, it must have been communicated to Galileo in manuscript,
thus shewing the interest already taken in Bacon’s writings. Itis
true, 1 believe, that Galileo makes no mention of Bacon's works,
but then, as 1 shall presently have occasion to remark, ¹and as we
have already seen in the case of Loelre‚ the habit oi referring to
. contemporary or recent writers was at this time comparatively
rare.

Vico, the celebrated Italian Publicist (b. 1668, d. 1744), frequently
alludes to Bacon. In the Scienza Nuova (in its second form), lib. ii.
(Worlrs, Milan Ed. of 1836, vol. v. p. 253), he bears this testimony:
‘Onde a gran ragione il Verulamio, gran filosofo egualmente e poli-
tic0, propone, commenda ed illustra l'Induzione nel suo Organ03
