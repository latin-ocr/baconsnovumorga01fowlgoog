various atoms of which matter was regarded as composed. Λεύκιππος δὲ
καὶ ὀ ἑταῖρος αὐτοῦ Δημόκριτος στοιχεῖα μὲν τὸ πλῆρες καὶ τὸ κενὸν εἶναι’ φασι.
Arist. Metaph. i.4 (985 b). Bacon, at least in this passage, while adopting the
opinion that matter, in its ultimate analysis, isan aggregate of minute par·
ticles, repudiates the assumption that these particles are separated hya
vacuum. His own view appears to have been that, ii we could discover
the inmost constitution of things, we should find the ultimate particles, not
separated by a vacuum, but so nicely adjusted as to leave no breach of
continuity in passing lrom one to another.

M. Bouillet gives an appropriate reference to the beginning of the
treatise ‘Cogitationes de Natura Rerum’ (E. aud S.‚ vol. iii. pp. 15, &c.).
Cp. also Nov. Org. l. 66, ad fin.

On the question whether Bacon did or did not reject the doctrine ol
avacuum, see my notes on ii. 48 (2) and on the conclusion of the same
Aphorism. ·

On the conception of ultimate particles of matter, cp. a very interesting
passage in Newton’s Optics, bk. iii. qu. 31 (Horsley’s Ed, vol. iv. pp. 260-1).

⁴⁷ Mr. Kitchin thinks that this expression refers to the Democritean
doctrine ol the Eternity of Matter. lllay not Bacon mean Discontinnous
Matter, which is implied, if we admit the theory ol a vacuum?

⁴⁷⁸ ‘Tones' are, as it were, the alphabet of Music, The above passage
is important as throwing light on Bacon's doctrine of forms and simple
natures. lt shews, as l have pointed out elsewhere, that he regarded the
‘simple natures’ as constituting a sort ol alphabet, and that he supposed
that, il we only possessed a complete knowledge of this alphabet, we should
be able to explain and reproduce nature in all her complexity.

⁴⁸ Cp. i. 9⁶ and note 7²· The meaning ol the passage in the text, when
taken in connection with the context, is somewhat doubtful. lt may refer
generally to the deductive branches ol natural philosophy, stated and
worked out mathematically (as l believe is the case with the passage in
i. 96), or (as the context would rather lead usto suppose) it may have
amore special reference. ln the latter case, it probably contemplates
the application of mathematice to the enumeration, mensuratim, and
determination ol the form of the ultimate particles of matter3 or possibly
it may have reference to the combination ol ‘simple natures' in concrete
substances, mathematics being applied to determine the number ol such
