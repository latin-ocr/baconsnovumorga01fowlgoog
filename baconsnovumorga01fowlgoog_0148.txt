3rd, In both these ways, Bacon recalled men to the study of facts,
and though, in the first instance, he had mainly in view the facts of
external nature, the influence of his teaching soon extended itself, as
he undoubtedly purposed that it should do, to the facts of mind,
conduct, and society. The inductive study ol Mental, Moral, and
Political Philosophy, which has been the distinctive characteristic of
the best English thought from the end of the seventeenth century
onwards, is, it seems to me, no less really, though 1 grant it is less

obviously, a result of the Baconian teaching than the inductive study
of Natural Philosophy.

4th, In order to set men free to study facts, it was necessary to
deliver thern from the pernicious subjection to authority, to which they

had so long been enslaved. Here and there throughout the Middle
Ages, a solitary thinlrer, lilre Roget Bacch, may have asserted his
independence, and, during the century preceding Bacon's time, the
murmurs of discontent had been becoming loud and frequent, but it
required a clear, shrill voice, like that of the author of the Great
instauration, effectually to awalren men from their slumber. Bacon
seems to have been thoroughly impressed with the feeling that there
was no hope for human fortunes, unless these bonds could be brolren;
and hence the tone of intended and conscious exaggeration with
which he often sets about this task, as is especially the case in the
Temporis Partus Masculus and some parts of the Novum Organum.
Nor can I doubt that his utterances on this subject had lar more
influence in producing the intellectuat revolution which followed than
the utterances of any one of his predecessors, or, perhaps, than those
oi all taken together. It would hardly, l thinis, be an exaggeration to
compare Bacon, in the intellectual sphere, with Luther, in the sphere
of religion. And, in truth, there was much in common between the
two men. Both of thern were intensely impressed with the importance
and reality ol their mission; both of them were grimly in eamest;
both of them spurned all obstacles in existing opinion, and even
exaggerated the differences between themselves and their opponents;
and, lastly, each of thern retained, far more than he suspected, the
habits of thought, the more deeply·engrained prejudiceS, and even
the more misleading forms of expression of his time. Each of them,
in fact, sowed the seed, without knowing altogether clearly what
manner of fruit it was likely to bring forth.

5th, Hardly less important than deliverance from the bondage of
authority was the emancipation of reason from the bewitching en·
chantments ol imagination. ‘Hypotheses non lingo' was a maxim
