⁸ media axiomata frustra adhibetur ¹⁴, cum sit¹⁶ subtilitati
naturae longe impar. Assensum itaque constringit, non res,

XIV.

Syllogismus ex propositionibus constat, propositiones ex
verbis, verba notionum tesserae sunt ¹⁶. Itaque si notiones
ipsae (id quod basis rei est) confusae sint, et temere a rebus
abstractae; nihil in iis, quae superstruuntur, est firmitudinis.
Itaque spes est una in inductione vera¹⁷.

XV.

In notionibus nil sani est, nec in logicis, nec in physicis:
non substantia, non qualitas, agere, pati, ipsum esse, bonae
notiones sunt; multo minus grave, aaa, denarum, tenue, harmi-
dum, siccum, generatio, corruptio, attrahere, fugare, elementum,

¹⁴ For if the principia scientiarum be uncertain, the axiomata media,
which are deduced from them, must, of course, be uncertain as well.
We cannot rely on the truth of the conclusion, till we have placed beyond
doubt the truth of the premisses.

¹⁵ The reason here assigned applies to both the preceding clauses.

¹⁶ The spoken or written word, it is true, is only the symbol of the
notion in the mind of the speaker or writer, but could the notion itself
he formed or retained without the use of language? -This or that
particular word is, of course, separable from the corresponding idea (as

, is shewn by the mere fact of translation from one language luto another),

but, without the use of signs of some kind or other, we could hardly think
at all. These considerations, however, do not affect the truth oi Bacon's
criticism. Wbether we speak of the ultimate constituents of the syllogisrn
as words or notione, it is essential to all reasoning that we should have a
clear understanding of them.

¹⁷ Cp. ii. 19, with the notes on that Aphorism. nt first sight, it
may not seemplaln why it should be the office of induction to remedy
the defect of obscure, false, or inadequate notlons. But all notione,
we must recollect, involve judgrneuts. ln forming or attempting to
realise a notion, we really assert a number of propositions. Thus
if l put before my mind the notion of gold, l think of it as yellow,
malleable, heavy, capable of being erchanged etc, and, without forming
these judgments,l should not realise the notion. Now, when we are
dealing with Nature, sound judgments, and, therefore, sound notions cau
only be gained by observation of facts and a legitimate generalisation from
those facts. We may see from what has been said that the Definition
of natural objects or qualities (as distinct from merely technical terme)
ought always to rest on previous inductions.
