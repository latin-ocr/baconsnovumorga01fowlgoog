including certain statements on the Trinity and the division of the
elect and reprobate, which occurs towards the end of the Advance-
ment ofLearning, is altogether left out in the De Augmentis, published
eighteen years afterwards. Nor, generally, do 1 notice in Bacon's
later works any disposition to enter into details on the more specific
doctrines of religion²¹.

5th. Connected with this fact, is the very wide toleration which he
was evidently ready to concede to dissidents from the more generally
received theological opinions. Witness the following passages from
the essay Of Unity in Religion: ‘Conceming the Bounds of Unity3
the true placing of them importeth exce'edingly. There appear to be
two extremes. For to certain zelants all speech of pacification is
odious. Is it peace, seha? What has! thou io do with peace? turn thee
abead me. Peace is not the matter, but following and party. Con·
trariwlse, certain Laodiceans and lukewarm persons think they may
accommodate points of religion by middle ways and taking part of
both, and wittyreconcilements; as if they would make an arbitrement
between God and man. Both these extremes are to be avoided;
which will be done, il the league of Christians penned by our Saviour
himself were in the two cross clauses thereos soundly and plainly
cxpouuded: He that ir ml wr'tlr us r's agaim us,· and again, He thar
tino! against us is wath un· that is, if the points fundamental and of
substance in religion were truly discerned and distinguished from
points not merely of saith, but of opinion, order, or good intention.
This is a thing may seem to many a matter trivial, and done already.
But if it were done less partially, it would be embraced more generally!

¹¹ Macaulay (Essay ou Bacon) says. ou the whole, very truly: ‘He loved to
dwell ou the power of the Christian religion to effect much that the ancient philo·
sophera could only promise. He loved to consider that religion as the bond of
charity, the curb of evil passione, the consolation of the wretched, the support of the
timid, the hope of the dying. But controversias on speculative points of theology
seem to bave engaged scarcely any portion of his attention. lu what he wrote on
Church Government he shewed, as iar as he dared, a tolerant aud charitable spirit.
He troubled himself not at all about Homoousiaus and Homoiousiaus, Monothe·
lites aud Nestoriaus. He lived in an ageio which disputes on the most subtie
points of divinlty excited au intense interest throughout Europe, and nowhere more
than in England. He was placed iu the very thick of the conflict. He was in
power at the time of the Synod of Dort. aud must for mouths have been daily
deafened with talk about electiori, reprobatiou‚ and final perseverance. Yet we do
not remember a liue in his works from which it can be inferred that he was either
aCalvinist or au Aminiam! 1 am disposed, however, to think that this description
applies with more complete accuracy to Bacou's later thau his earlier state of feel·
ing on these subiecta.
