suevimus. Eae sunt quae constituunt unam speciem naturae
inquisitae tanquam Formam Minorem. Cum enim formae
legitimae (quaesunt semper convertibiles cum naturis inqui-
sitis) lateant in profundo nec facile inveniantur, postulat res
et infirmitas humani intellectus ut formae particulares ⁰⁸, quae
sunt congregativae Manipulorum quorundam instantiarum
(neutiquam vero omnium) in notionem aliquam communem,
non negligantur, verum diligentius notentur. Quicquid enim
unit naturam, licet modis imperfectis ad inventionem for·
marum viam sternit ltaque instantiae, quae ad hoc utiles
sunt non sunt contemnendae potestatis, sed habent nonnullam
praerogativam.

Verum in his diligens est adhibenda cautio, ne intellectus

Professor Playfair adduces as examples uf ‘Collective lnstances' the
three laws of Kepler, which subsequently, in the hands of Newton, led to
the discovery of the great principle of Gravitation. ‘These discoveries
were all made before Bacon wrote, but he is silent conceruing them3 for
the want of mathematical knowledge concealed from his view some of the
most splendid and interesting parts of science!

‘Astronomy is full of such collective instances, and alfords them, indeed,
oi the second and third order, that is to say, two or three times gene·
ralised. The astronomer observes nothing but that a certain luminous
dish, or perhaps merely a luminous point, is in a certain position, in respect
of the planes of the meridian and the horizon, at a certain moment of
time. By comparing a number of such observations, he finds that this
luminous point moves in a certain plane, with a certain velocity, and per·
forms a revolution in a certain time. Thus, the periodic time of a planet
is itself a collective fact, or a single fact expressing the result of many
hundred observations. This holds with respect to each planet, and with
respect to each clement, as it is called, of the planet's orbit, every one of
which is a general fact, expressing the result of an indefinite number of
particulam. This holds still more remarkably of the inferences which
extend to the distances of the planet from the earth, or from the sun.
The laws of Kepler are therefore collective facts of the second, or even
ahigher order; or such as comprehend a great number of general facts,
each of which is itself a general fact, including many particulare! Pre-
liminary Dissertation.

'⁶ These formae minores or particulares correspond with the axiomata
infima or some of the lower degrees of the axiomata media 0ka. i. (see,
for instance, i. 104). They might be described as the definitions of specilic
(though still general) exemplifications of the nature under examination.
Cp. the last paragraph of the Aphorism.
