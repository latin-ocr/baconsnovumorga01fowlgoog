140 INTRODUCTION.

Liebig's onslaught on Bacon (Ueber Francis Bacon von Verulam)
appeared both in German and in English in 1863, and was followed
by a keen controversy between Liebig and Sigwart. (See the next
semion, on the Bibliography of the Novum Organum.) The occasion
of this work was Liebig's annoyance at the rejection of some of his
chemieal theories by English agriculturists. Their singular obstinacy
must, he thought, be due to 00100 inherent defect in the English
mind, and this suspicion led him to the study of the English phi-
losophers. When, at last, he came to the works of Bacon, all was
clear. These fumished, if not the source, at least the typical example
of the methods 01 experiment and reasoning common amongst the
English dilettanti, who had had the temerity to reject his theories.
The study of Bacon thus acquired the charrn of a scientific discovery;
the writer, he tells us, went much deeper than before into the subject,
and, hence, the work before us (see Preface to German Edition).

l have no hesitation in saying that this work, which is extremely
bitter in tone, and often very inaccurate, contributes nothing to the
knowledge or appreciation of Bacon's philosophy. lt repeats the
thread-bare arguments employed by Brewster and Lasson, but with
an amount of exaggeration and asperity which is utterly foreign
to the second, and would, I think, have been distasteful even to the
first of these writers. The author is, at times, almost 00 violent as De
Maistre or Stubbe. Thus (Ι quote fromtheEnglish text): ‘Bacon is con·
scious thatin most instances he is 001 truthful, and has the prudence
to blunt the weapons 01 010 adversaries beforehand;' ‘Vaiu sels-praise
and detraction of others' merit go always hand in hand with his
lordship, just as with other vulgar specimens 01 humanity3’ ‘When
a boy, he studied jugglery, and his cleverest trich 01 all, that of
deceiving the world, was quite successful3' ‘Nature that had endowed
him so richly with her best gifts, had denied him all sense for truth ;'
he is the type ‘of the scientific out-cracker or the dining philosopher,
which, under James I, became the fashion ‘⁸3' his scientific investiga·

⁸⁸ ln 000 01 the numbers of the Allgenreine Zeituug (Nor. 7, 1863), Liebig
waxes still more wroth. After describing Bacon’s work 00 0 0011001010 011110
