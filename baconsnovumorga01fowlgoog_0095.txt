INTRODUCTION.

ᾗ 12. THE REACTION AGAINST THE AUTHORl'l'Y
OF ARISTOTLE.

The violence with which Bacon attacks the person and philosophy
os Aristotle is by no means peculias to him; an exaggerated reaction
against the authority oi the Aristotelian philosophy was a common
'feature of his time and of that immediately preceding it. The
exaggerated reverence lor an author not unnaturally leads toan
exaggerated depreciation os him, and the appeal which men were at
one time in the habit of constantly making to the authority of the
great philosopher as a final arbiter os all controversy may, at least,
excuse, il it does not justily, the virulence and bitterness with which
his name was handled by the advocates of a new method and the
exponents ofa new learning.

Ι shall not attempt to describe the varying fortunes os Aristotle
in the schools os the Middle Ages, the gradual diffusion oi his worlrs,

hands of the Reformers, who, with the one exception of Melanchthon,
so bitterly, and often so ignorantly, opposed it. As illustrating the
position os Bacon‚ 1 am concerned solely with the philosophical
reaction against the Aristotelian method and doctrine, and this it
may be interesting to the reader to see exemplified at some length.

Even so early as the twellth century, we find J0hn ol' Salisbury
(b. about 1120, d. 1180) thinking it necessary to warn his readers
that Aristotle had ‘erred in many things! ln the curious and
interesting treatise, entitled ‘hletalogicua' he granta, on the one hand,
that Aristotle was pre-eminently ‘the philosopher,' and, in the art
of dialectic at least, excelled all others: ‘Sed curn singuli suis meritis
splendeant, omnes se Aristotelis adorare vestigia gloriantur, adeo
quidem ut commune omnium philosophorum nomen praeeminentia
quadam sibi proprium lecerit Nam et antonomatice, id est excel-
