112 INTRODUCYION.

He then describes how he chased away Authority, ’

‘Nor suifcr’d Living men to be misled
By the vain shadows oi the Deadr'

how he broke the ‘sear-crow Deitie' oi the orchard, how he brought
the mind from words to things, &c

‘From these and all long Errors os the way,

In which our wandring Praedecessors went,

And like th· old Hebrews many years did stray
In Desarts but oi small extent,

Bacon like Moses. led us forth at last,
The barren Wilderness he past,
Did on the very Border stand
of the blest promis'd Laud,

It should be noticed that Sprat's book received the sanction oi the
Royal Society, and that copies oi it were sent by them to foreign
princes and other eminent persons on the continent. Hence Liebig's
sneer at Sprat (Aligemeine Zeitung, March 7, 18⁶4), unless he is
prepared to extend it generally to the members oi the Royal Society
at that time, is entirely out of place.

But there is much more evidence to the same effect. The cele·
brated mathematician‚ Dr. Wallis, in the very interesting Account
of some Passages oi his own Lise, published in Appendirn Num. xi, to
Heame's Presace to Peter Langtoft’s Chronicle¹⁹, says: ‘About the
year 1645, while 1 lived in London, * * * * * I had the opportunity
of being acquainted with divers worthy Persons, inquisitiva into
Natural Philosophy, and other parts of Humane Learning3 and
particularly oi what hath been called the New Philosophy or Ex-
perimental Philosophy! He then proceeds to give the names of his
associates and their places of maeting. ‘Our business was to Discourse
and consider oi Philosophical Enquiries, and such as related there·
untol * * * * * ‘Some oi which were then but New discoveries,
and others not so generally known and imbraced, as now they are,
with other things appertaining to what hath been called The New
Philosophy ; which from the times oi Galileo at Florence, and Sir
Francis Bacon (Lord Verulam) in England, harh been much culti·
vated in Italy, France‚ Germany, and other parts abroad‚ as well as
with us in England!
