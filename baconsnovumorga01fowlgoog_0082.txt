'The great difference which Bacon himself conceived as distinguish-
ing his own doctrine of Forms from that ol the Schoolmen was that,
whereas, with them, the ‘Form' simply replaced the thing to be
explained by some empty abstraction, with him, the ‘Form' was to
set forth the several conditions on which the phenomenon was de-
pendent, and thus render possible its artificial production. That this
conception, however obscurely and ambiguously it is often stated, is
an eminendy just and fertile one, cannot be doubted.

The reader, who is acquainted with the logie of Aristotle, will not
fail to notice the parallel between Bacon's conception ol ‘Form,' as
including the ideas ol essence, definition, and cause, and that class of
essential definitions in which the cause of the thing defined is set forth
in the definition, as, for instance, τί δ’ ἐστὶ βροντῆς ψόφος ἀποσβεννυμὲνου
πρὸς ἐν νέφεσιν (An. Post. ii. 10). To know a thing (that is, to know
its essence) and to know its cause are frequently stated by Aristotle
lo be identicai. Thus, rb ri ἔστιν εἰδέναι ταύτό ἐστι καὶ διὰ τί ἔστιν.

The reader will find a good account of ‘Form' in Mr. Ellis's
General Prelace to the Philosophical Works ol Bacon, sect. 8. My
conclusione are in general accordance with his, though Ι have arrived
at them by a somewhat different route.

Bacon evidently regarded this method as the corner-stone of his
system³⁸. See, lor instance, Nov. Org. i. 69,105; ii. 15, 16, 19.

Ι On the Aristotelian doctrine oi Definition, which presente several points of
interest in connection with what has been said in tbis section, see the excellent
monograph oi Rassow, Aristotelis de Notionis Definitione Doctrina, Berlin, 1843.
Those who have not acoess to this worlr may with advantage consult Grote’s
Aristotle or the Appendix on Definition in Mansel's Edition ol Aldricb.

³⁸ Mr. Ellis refers to a curious and apt passage in the exposition ol the Fable ol
Cupid (De Principiis atque Originibus, E. and S.. vol. iii. pp. 81, Sei: ‘quue a
parabola ipsa monemur, ubi eleganter fingitur Cupido, ovum Nocte incubante ex·
clusum. * * * * *Aptissime autem relertur illud de ovo Noctisad demonstrationes
per quas Cupido iste in lucem editur. Quae euim per affirmativas concluduntur,
videntur partus lucis, quaerero per negativas et exclusiones, ea tanquam a tene·
bris et nocte exprimuntur et educuntur. Est autem iste Cupido vere ovum
exclusum a Nocte; notltia enim ejus (quae omnino haberi potest) procedit per
exclusiones et negativas!
