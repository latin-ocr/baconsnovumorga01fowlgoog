and, lastly, in that for 1677, ‘many of the chief Universities in
Christendom have already formed themselves into Philosophical
Societies, and have so largely contributed their aydes to advance the
Lord‘Bacon’s Design for the Instauration of Arta and Sciences, that
it is now become above my abilities' &c.¹¹

Boyle, who was himself called a Second Bacon, and who lent
his rooms lor the meetings of the Royal Society during the
latter part of its Oxford career, is constantin his allusions to ‘our
illustrious Verulam‚' ‘that profound naturalist the Lord Verulam,' ‘so
judicious a friend to philosophy and mankind, as Sir Francis Bacon,'
‘our famous experimenter, the Lord Verulam 16666611,ι dac, &e.²¹
See his worlrs, passim. indeed Boyle seems to have been regarded,
in a special sense, as a disciple of Bacon. ln a letter to him, quoted
by Mr. Napier‚ from Dr. Beal, who was himself elected to the Royal
Society in 1662, the writer says: ‘You have particulariaed, explicated,
and exemplitied those fair encouragements and affectionate directions,
which Lord Bacon in a wide generality proposed.¹ Dr. Beal’s letters”,
which are somewhat lengthy, are full of allusions to Bacon. Thus,
he speaks of Boyle as ‘relieving Lord Bncon's Sylva, and his Novum
Organum, which oft-times want your aid,' and, in another letter, there

Europe to the influence of Bacon: ‘Sed. quae superest dicenda, supremam, et, ut

tst Ed.) says that 'the amiable and indefatigable Boyle treated Baoon with the
same disrespectful silence’ that Newton did. 'l'he silence of Neston I shall dismas
presently.
