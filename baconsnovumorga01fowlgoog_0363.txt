insist on knowing its inmost structure and the secret process by which it
had passed from its original condition into its present state.

¹⁴ Sc. primas partes. The passage to which he alludes is undoubtedly
Bk. i. Aph. 51, where the ‘forms' which he condemns are apparently the
ἰδέαι of Plato (cp. Bk. i. Aph. 65), and where he insists on the investigation

· of the matter rather than the form. ‘Materia potius considerari debet,

et ejus schematismi, et meta-schematismi, atque actus purus, et lex actus
sive motus; formae enim commenta animi humani sunt, nisi libeat leges
illas actus formas appellare.’ Forms (in the sense of the Platonists and
some of the Schoolmen), as abstracted from matter, Bacon rejected
altogether; instead of being the principal constituents or the main ground
of being (‘ primae partes essentiae '), he denied that they had any exist·
ence at all. His own ‘fomis’ whatever their precise character may have
been, were to be arrived at only by an investigation of matter, and
bad no existence apart from matter. Hence, the opposition between
form and matter had no place in his philosophy, and ‘to assign to forms
the principal share in being’ became an unmeaning phrase.

¹⁶ He is here again combating the Platonic and Scholastic Realism.
Strictly speaking, there exist only individual bodies, with their individual
manifestations. We may translate the next clause, ‘giving forth individual
manifestations (ἐνέργειαι) according to law? The laws according to which
individual bodies exhibit their various manifestations are the proper object
of knowledge, and such knowledge is the only gulde to practice.

This sentence, combined with Blr. i. Aph. 1, affords, perhaps, one of the
best statements we have of the Nominalist, as opposed to the Realist,
theory of the nature and objects of knowledge.

¹⁶ ‘Clauses' or ‘sections' l think that Mr. Ellis (see General Preface,
p. 31) interprets this term rightly, in referring it to the ‘simple natures’
into which Bacon (see Bk. ii. Aph. 17) regarded the forms of substances as
admitting of resolution. A ‘forma copulata' (as of lion, gold, dcc.) isa
‘conjugium naturarum simplicium,' and hence the ‘simple natures’ may be
regarded as ‘clauses’ of the forma copulata.

There would, however, be no difficulty in interpreting ‘paragraphus'
with reference to the ‘forms' of the ‘simple natures’ themselves. The,
