experientiae ⁸, magis quam scientiis: scientiae enim, quas
nunc habemus, nihil aliud sunt quam quaedam concinna-
tiones rerum antea inventarum3 non modi inveniendi, aut
designationes novorum operum.

Causa vero et radix lere omnium malorum in scientiis ea
una est3 quod dum mentis humanae vires salso miramur ct
extollimus, vera ejus auxilia non quaeramus.

Subtilitas naturae subtilitatem sensus et intellectus multis
partibus superat⁹; ut pulchrae illae meditationes et specula·

the word seems to differ lrorn this only in restricting it to general
propositions, that is, iu excludlng the ‘axioma particulare' and the
‘axioma proprium' of the Ramists.

The word is frequently restricted to seli-evident propositions, whether
common to all sciences, or peculiar to some particular science. Thus
Chauvin in his Lexicon Philosophicum defines an Arriom as ‘sententia
generalis cuilibet attendenti nota,' and we commonly spealr of truths,
which require no proof, as ‘axiomatie’

Newton’s use of the word appears to be less general than that of Bacon.
Though he does not restrict it to sels-evident propositions, or to those
truths which are common to all sciences, he appears to use it exclusirely of
the first principles of any particular science. Thus, in the Principia,
he speaks of the ‘ Axiomata sive Leges Motus,' and at the beginning oi the
Optics he enumeratas five Axioms, such as that ‘The Angles of Reiiexion
and Rehaction lie in one and the same Plane with the angle of Incidence‚'
‘The Angle of Reilexion is equal to the Angle oi Incidence‚' etc. These
would answer to the ‘Axiomata Generalissima’ of Bacon.

We have seen that Cicero proposes the word ‘pronuntiatum’ as a
translation os ἀξίωμα in its more general sense, when used as the equi·
valent ol proposition. The words ‘maxim’ ‘principle,’ or ‘dignitas'
sometimes replace it in its more restricted senses.

The student will find a long note on the etymology and meaning of
the word ‘Axium’ in Hamilton’s edition of Reid, pp. 764-6. ³·

⁸ ἐμπειρία, empiricism, mere experience, as distinguished from properly
directed observation and experiment. F or a distinction between the
different kinds of experieuce and their bearing on discovery, see De
Augmentis, lib. v. cap. a.

⁹Mr. Kitchin here very appositely quotes Aristotle, Metaph. α. r.
'lons ul καὶ τῆς χαλεπότητος οὔσης κατὰ δύο τρόπους, οὐκ ἐν τοῖς πράγμασιν,
ἀλλ’ ε’ν ἡμῖν τὸ αἴτεον αὐτῆς. Ὠσπερ γὰρ καὶ τὰ τῶν νυκτερίδων ὄμματα πρὸς τὸ
φέγγος ἔχει τὸ μεθ’ ἡμέραν, οὕτω καὶ τῆς ἡμετέρας ψυχῆς ὁ νοῦς πρὸς τὰ τῇ
φύσει φανερώτατα πάντων.
