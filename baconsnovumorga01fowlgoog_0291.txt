268 NOVUM ORGANUM.

est, postquam Christiana fides recepta suisset et adolevisset,
longe maximam ingeniorum praestantissimorum partem ad
theologiam se contulisse; atque huic rei et amplissima
praemia proposita, et omnis generis adjumenta copiosissime
subministrata luisse: atque hoc theologiae studium praecipue

occupasse tertiam illam partem sive periodum temporis apud
nos Europaeos occidentales; eo magis, quod sub idem sere
tempus et literae florere, et controversiae circa religionem
pullulare coeperint. At aevo superiori, durante periodo illa
secunda apud Romanos potissimae philosophorum medita·
tiones et industriae in morali philosophia (quae ethnicis vice
theologiae erat ¹⁸) occupatae et consumptae fuerunt: etiarn

moralis et civilis, et scientiae logicae’ are regarded as receiving their
proper nutriment from Natural Philosophy, which has for its object not
only motious, rays, sounds‚ &c., but also ‘affectus et prehensiones in-
tellectuales! ln the two books ol the Advancement ot' Learning, the
account ol the respective fonctions of the Philosophia Prima aud Natural
Philosophy is substantially the same as that in the De Augnrentis. Cp. also
Bk. i. Aph. 127 of the Novum Organum. One cau hardly avoid the con-
clusion that, in the Aphorisms now under discussion, Bacon has coufounded
the conception of Natural Philosophy with that ol the Philosophia Prima.

This difficulty having been pointed out, the subsequent notes to these
two Aphorisms must be regarded as applying to Natural Philosophy only as
here understood.

¹⁸ lo the corresponding passage ol the Cogitata et Visa, Gruter, though
not the Qteen’s College MS, reads ‘quae Ethnicis, magna ex parte, vice
Theologiae erat!

The Greek aod Roman religions contained little theology in our sense
oi the term. They recognised uo creeds, catechisms, or articles oi laith.
Nor were the priests of the classical religions, like ours, moral audi
religious teachers. Thelreligion was mainly a cult, aud the priests were l
almost exclusively the perlonners of rites and sacrifices. into a mao’s'
religious convictions, so long as he kept the required religious observances,
few cared to enquire. Nor, again, though certain crimes, such as horni-
cide, the refusal oi hospitality, the breach oi au oath, the removal of a
boundary‚ &c., were supposed to be avenged by certain deities, was there
any definite aud detalled connection between the religion and the morality
ol classical times. Ol the divorce between the popular religion aud what
we understand by morality, we cannot have better examples tbao those
adduced by Plato in the sod aud 3rd Books of the Republic.

Hence, it naturally happened that the discussions asto the nature of
the Gods and the grounds and precepts ol morallty fell into the hands
ol the philosophers. Theology, as treated by them, assumed a meta·
plrysical character, having little orno practical bearing ou the affairs ot
