ol these respects, the method of Bacon is to be found embodied in
the teaching and example of Aristotle, and even of Socrates and
Plato. Induction ol some sort or other, and, consequently, the
examination and collection of facts, is as old as human reasoning.
This object gave me pleasure or pain yesterday, and, therefore, 1 will
pursue or avoid a similar object to·day; or I compassed my ends
in this way yesterday, and, therefore, 1 will try a similar mode again
to-day, are amongst the earliest thoughts which would occur to man.
It is, therefore, ol course, absurd to represent Bacon as the author or
discoverer of Induction. What logicians have done is not to invent
forms ol reasoning, but to analyse‚ criticise, and offer rules and
cautious for securing the due perlormance oi those which already exist.
Hence, it would be utterly superfluous to accumulate early instances
ol inductive reasoning} as respects my present purpose, it is quite
sufficient to refer to the ἐπακτικοὶ λόγου or παραβολὴ oi Socrates ⁰⁴,
and to gire a very briei account oi Aristotle's method, so far as it
relates to the present question.

To my mind nothing can be clearer than that Aristotle rests all
evidence ultimately on the observation ol individual sacts. See, for
instance, Metaph. i. r, Post. An. ii. 19. And, in accordance with this
doctrine, the ultimate mayor premiss ol any train of deductive
reasoning must itsell rest on an induction from particulars. Ἐκ

l. 18. Unlortunately, Aristotle went no further in his formal analysis
ol induction than to reduce it to the syllogistic type, and, as an almost
necessary consequence of this procedure, he required an exhaustive
enumeration ol all the· instances (Inductio per Enumerationem Sim-
plicem or Inductio Completa). Δεῖ δὲ νοεῖν τὸ Γ τὸ ἐξ ἁπάντων τῶν καθ’

in most cases, it was impossible to satisly this requirement in practice,
we find him, as a matter ol lact, selecting his instances, and that often
with great skillll, though sometimes, it must be confessed, with much
