384 NOVUM ORGANUM.

(ut memini) hoc fit; ut si speculum ponatur (exempli gratia)
ad distantiam spithamae ab objecto combustibili, non tanto-
pere iucendat aut adurat quam si positum fuerit speculum
(exempli gratia) ad distantiam semi-spithamae, et gradatim
et lente trahatur ad distantiam spithamae. Conus tamen et
unio radiorum eadem sunt, sed ipse motus auget operationem
caloris⁵⁸· ’

29. Existimantur incendia illa, quae fiunt flante vento forti,
majores progressus facere adversus ventum quam secundum
ventum; quia scilicet flamma resilit motu perniciore, vento
remittente, quam procedit, vento impellente⁵⁹.

30. Flamma non emicat aut generatur, nisi detur aliquid
concavi inquo flamma movere possit et ludere⁶⁰ 3 praeterquam
in flammis flatuosis pulveris tormentarii‚ et similibus, ubi
compressio et incarceratio flammae auget ejus furorem ⁰¹.

31. incus per malleum calefit admodum; adeo ut si incus
fuerit laminae tenuioris existimemus illam per fortes et con-
tinuos ictus mallei posse rubescere, ut ferrum ignitum⁶²; sed ’
dehoc liat experimentum.

32. At in ignitis quae sunt porosa, ita ut detur spatium ad
exercendum motum ignis, si cohibeatur hujusmodi motus per
compressionem sortem, statim extinguitur iguis; veluti curn

⁶⁸ The only explanation of this curious supposition‚ as ΜΓ. Ellis suggests,
is that the focal length of the lens lay between a span and half a span, aud
was found by nroviug the lens. Bacon's remark, it must be confessed,
¹ betrays great ignorance of the laws of Optics.

⁶⁹ Here the fact is inaccurately stated, and the reason assigned fanciful.
ln a fire, however, the flames will burn most brightly where the wind is
highest (provided it is not sufficiently violent to put them out), the reason
being that fresh supplies of oxygen are being constantly brought into con·
tact with the ignited mass.

⁶⁰ ln ordinary cases, a supply of oxygen is essential to combustion, and,
therefore, there must be contact with the air. ‘But combustion does not
necessarily involve the presence of oxygen. lf either powdered antimony
or a fragment of phosphorus be placed in a vessel of chlorine, it unites with
chlorine, producing thereby beat and fleme! Ganot's Physica oth Ed,
P· 385·

⁸¹ ln this case, the supply of oxygen is derived from the saltpetre. lt
is, perhaps, needless to add that the amount of explosion is exactly the same
in the gun as it would be in the open air.

⁸² This would be so. Bacon was here on the right track for discovering
the connection between heat aud motion.
