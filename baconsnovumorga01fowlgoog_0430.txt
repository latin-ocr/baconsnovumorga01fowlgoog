Inter Praerogativas Instantr'arum ³¹, primo proponemus

The attempt is interesting and ingenious, but it is too conjecturai, as weil
as too lengthy, to admit of being reproduced here. The reader, however,
would do weil to compare with this Aphorism the Partis Secundae De·
lineatio (E. and S., voi. iii. pp. 547·57)·

²⁹ He seems here to contemplate the arrangement nithe simple natures,
or, at least, the principai ones, in a kind oi hierarchy, according to their
relative importance, as in the sixth division he designs an exhaustive
enumeration of thern.

³⁰ Towards this division we have a contribution in the tract printed
at the end oi the first edition of the Novum Organum, entitled ‘ Parasceue,’
dvc. Bacon expressiy says in the Introduction to it: ‘Huic autem rei iocus
proprius foret quum ad Parasceuas inquisitionis ordine deventum fuerit.
Hoc vero praevertere, nec iocum proprium expectare, consultius nobis
videtur!

³¹ in hph. 52, these Praerogativae instantiarum are divided into such as
are concemed ‘circa partem informativam' (1-20, of which 1-15 ‘juvant
intellectum,’ 16-20 ‘juvant sensum’), and such as are concemed ‘circa
partem operativam' (ar-27). For further subdivisions, see the Aphorism
itseif.

This portion oi the Novum Organum, it must be confessed, is defective
iu arrangement, nor does it supply any systematic set of ruies for the
investigation oi nature. it consists rather of a miscellaneous collection
oi remarks, hints, and directions, many of which are exceedingiy vaiuabIe
and suggestive, though often expressed in i'ancifui ianguage and often
iilustrated by exampies which we should now deem worthiess and unsci-
entiiic. Of Bacon's terminoIogy, however, i may remark that it has at
least been so felicitousiy selected, as in many cases to have left a per-
manent mark on the ianguage, as, for example, in the expressions ‘Cruciai
instance,' ‘Giaring instance,' ‘Ciandestine Instance,’ and the like.

in the Partis Secundae Delineatio (E. and 8., voi. iii. p. 5 56), the Prae·
rogativa instantiae together with the Praerogatira inquisiti are described
as constituting the ‘inquisitionis contracti0,’ which has for its office ‘ut
uon tantum in inviis via, sed in viis compendium, et tanquam linea recta
