effecte from causes. According to the other conception, it is the law
according to which the phenomenon in question is developed out of
preeaisting conditione, or, taking into account the conditione, it is, in
brief, its cause. But, practically (and the practical interest is with
Bacon, we must recollect, always supreme), these two conceptione
may, if we take a sufficiently sanguine view ol human power, be
regarded as leading to the same result. Given the aggregate of
primary and underived attributes, and we are ableto produce the
phenomenon, or, rather, it follows as a matter of course. Given the
preexisting conditione and the law ol their development, and (on the
important assumption that we are able to put this law in action, that
we possess an ‘efficiens’ as a‘vehiculum formae ') we are ourselves
able to produce the effect. Thus, the knowledge of the essence (in
the sense which I have attached to that word) and the knowledge of
the cause are, for all practica] purposes‚ the same³⁸. lf, to take
Bacon’s instances, we know that heat consists in a certain kind of
motion, or whiteness in a certain juxtaposition ol particles, we are
already acquainted with the law of its development or cause of its
production. Or, to take Lasalle’s instance of ‘Form ' (which seems
to me a very good one), if we are acquainted with Newton's analysis
of a white ray of light into the several coloured rays of which itis
composed, it is indifferent whether we speak ol these rays as consti-
tuting ( = being the essence ol) whiteness, or as producing ( ι being
the cause ol) whiteness. And, as substances or concrete bodies were,
according to Bacon’s conception, ‘formae copulatae,' or combinatione
ol certain ‘simple natures,' a knowledge of the ‘essence' would, in
their case also, be equivalent to a knowledge ol the ‘cause' So far,
indeed, did Bacon carry this idea that he supposed that, if we could
ever attain (as he did not despair of attaining) to a knowledge ol the
various ‘simple natures' which constitute substances, we should be
able, by superimposing thern severally, one on the other, to produce
the substance in question. See, lor instance, the beginning ol the
5th Aphorism ol the Second Book of the Novum Organum, which
surnishes a good example both ol the simplicity which he ascribed to
Nature and of the sanguine expectations which he bad formed ol our
ultimate power over its operatione.

⁸⁸ To this explanation it might certainlybe objectcd that 1 am conlounding laws ol
coexisteuce with laws of succession. But then, 1 think, it might be replied tlrat we
must conceive ol the secondery or derived qualities as sollorrr'rrg on the collocation of
the primary or underived quilities, eveu though the time occupied be infinitesimal.
