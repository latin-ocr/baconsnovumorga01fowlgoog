theory and successfully adopted in practice. The argument from
Ι Authority (as we have seen, both in this and the last section) had been
combated by many with at least sufficient vehemence, nor had the
fancies and arbitrary hypotheses of philosophers escaped the animad-
versions even of those who were equally ready to give play to their
own imagination. But, so far as 1 can ascertain, no one had yet
pronounced himself evenon these topics with so much point and
force, or in a manner so well calculated to lay hold of the popular
sympathy, as Bacon, while, with respect to the fertile conception of
a scientific and methodical process of induction, as opposed to that
then in vogue, 1 have found nothing in any previous writer which
can properly and fairly be said to be an anticipation of the sug·
gestions so abundantly scattered throughout theNovum Organum.
To these conclusions I shall hereaster revert in another section, that
on the Present Value of Bacon’s Logical Works.

One who claims to be aRefonner of Scientific Method may

of knowledge only, but, though it may be in varying degrees, on
all branches of knowledge alike. For, different as may be its appli-
catione, the fundamental characteristica ol Logical Method are the

Philosophia, an etiam de scientiis reliquis, Logicis, Ethicis‚ Politicis,
secundum viam nostram perficiendis loquamur. At nos certe de
universis haee quae dicta sunt intelligimus: atque quemadmodum
vulgaris logica, quae regit res per Syllogismum, non tanturn ad
naturales, sed ad omnes scientias pertinet ; ita et nostra, quae pro·
cedit per Inductionem, omnia complectitur! (Nov. Org. i. 127.)

We may, therefore, conveniently divide the subjectos this section by
asking, 1st, what was the influence of Bacon's Reform on Philosophy
(under which head I include all enquin‘es into the grounds, conditions,
and character ol human knowledge and human practice), and and, what
was its influence on Science (a word which Ι take in its modern '
