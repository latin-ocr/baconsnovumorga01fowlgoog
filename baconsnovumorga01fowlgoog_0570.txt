tionem aut separationem aliquam, sed situm, et collocationem,
et configurationem cum aliis. Est autem iste motus valde
abstrusus, nec bene inquisitus. Atque in quibusdam videtur
quasi incausabilis ; licet revera (ut existimamus) non ita sit.
Etenim si quaeratur cur potius coelum volvatur ab oriente in
occidentem quam ab occidente in orientem³⁹; aut cur vertatur
circa polos positos juxta Ursas potius quam circa Orionem,
aut ex alia aliqua parte coeli⁴⁰: videtur ista quaestio tanquam
quaedam extasis ⁴¹, cum ista potius ab experientia, et ut posi·
tiva ⁴² recipi debeant. At in natura profecto sunt quaedam

cellular structure of animals and plants, or the tendency of each particular
species to assume a definite shape. l cannot agree with Dr. Hippus that
there is anything strange in referring to this head the directions of the
celestial motions or the polarity of the magnetic needle.

³⁰ Or, as we should put it, why the earth rotates from west to east.
This direction of motion, whether orbital or axial, as we have already seen
(see ii. 3⁶ (a) with note 92), is common to all the planets and their satel-
lites, with the sole known exception of the satellites oi Uranus. Moreover,
the sun itself rotates on its axis in the same directior. For Laplace's cal-
culations, by which he showed the enormously preponderating probability
of some common cause for this uniformity of direction, see Jevons’ Prin·
ciples of Science, vol. i. pp. 287-9, and the works, on both sides of the
question, there referred to. This cause is, in all probability, connected
with the circumstances of the detachment of the planets or satellites from
the central mass of which they are supposed, according to the nebular
hypothesis, to have originally formed a part. For this ingenious theory
and for the earlier one of Buffon, which had forits object the explanation
of the same phenomena, see Laplace, Exposition du Systeme du Monde,
note vii. (OEuvres, vol. vi. p. 470, δια).

⁴⁰ Mr. Ellis, commenting ou the corresponding passage below, says:
‘This passage shows that Bacon was not aware that the poles are not sured
(collocati) anywhere; iu other words, that he was not acquainted with the
precession of the equinoxes3-an additional proof how little of his attention
bad been given to mathematical physics.’ ln the Historia Ventorum (E.
and S., vql. ii. p. πθ), as Mr. Spedding has pointed out, he speaks of the
north pole as being above, and the south pole below us. See Mr. Sped-
ding’s Preface to the De interpretatione Naturae Prooemium, vol. iii.
p. 51²·

⁴¹ ἔκστασις, a displacement, or a standing aside. We may construe ‘out
of place! The word is common in Aristotle.

⁴² ‘As ultimate facts! Cp. i. 48, with note 73. However far we may
carry our speculations, there is always something beyond which is left
unexplained. And this the human mind, with its restless activity, at-
tempts, and cannot but attempt, to resolve. There must always, it istrie,
