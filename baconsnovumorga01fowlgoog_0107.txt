corum adversus peripateticos Parisiis propositorum. 111 the Dedica-
tion prefixed to this work, he says that 111 should not have written the
book, had 111 thought that the University ol Paris owed more to
Aristotle, than Aristotle to it. In the celebrated Dialogue, entituled
‘La Cena de le Ceneri,' Bruno states that the most enthusiastic ad·
herents ol Aristotle (‘who are the enemies of those who are not the
friends ol Aristotle, who would live and die lor Aristotle’) are often
entirely ignorant ol the meaning oi even the titles of his works (‘i
quali non intendono ne anche quel che significano i titoli de libri
d'Aristotele’). He adds that the real question which ought to be
debated between the Aristotelians and their opponente is not whether
a doctrine be old or new, but whether it be true or salse ⁸².

Campanella(b. 1568,d. 1639)was an enthusiastic follower ol Telesio,
and one ol the more outspoken oi the anti-Aristoteliam. One of his
works, published at Naples in 1591, was entituled Philosophia sen·
sibus demonstrata; adversus eos qui proprio arbitratu, non autem
sensata duce natura philosophati sunt: cum vera defensione Bemardi
Telesii. The Prelace to this work, written in 1589, abounds in open
or covert attacks on Aristotle. Campanella’s objections to the phi-
losophy of Aristotle were based as much on theological as on philoso-
phical grounds. In a work entituled Disputatio in Prologum Instaura-
tamm Scientiarum ad Scholas Christianas, praesertim Parisienses, the
reader will find a very curious list ol these theological objectione.

Bacon, 111 attacks Aristotle sorbis treatment of the older Greek
Philosophers. Thus, he quotes with approbation the words ol Cabaeus,
the last author on our list, when describing Aristotle as ‘adeo male
