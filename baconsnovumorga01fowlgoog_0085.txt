62 INTRODUCTION.

A third remark is one which 1 have frequently had occasion
to make in the notes on the early Aphorisms of the Second Book,
namely, that the whole of the enquiry into Fonn, and, consequently, the
Method of Exclusions, proceeds on the assumption that every
phenomenon has only one cause, that is to say, is due to only one
set of conditions. Of the ‘simple natures' there is some one, and
one only, which, if it could be found, is the ‘Form' of the ‘natura
data' ‘Turn vero post rejectionem et exclusivam debitis modis factam,
secundo loco *** manebit *²¹¹* forma affirmativa! But the same
event, as is so often and so justly insisted on by Mr. Mill, whenever
he has occasion to speak of what he terms ‘Plurality of causes:
may be due to one set of conditions at one nme and to a different
set of conditions at another. (On Bacon's neglect of this consideration,
see Mill’s Logic, bk. v. ch. 3. ξ 7.) Hence, though it is invariably
true that the same cause is always followed by the same effect,
the converse proposition that the same effect is always due to the
same cause would frequently be misleading. Of Bacon's criteria of a
Fonn, therefore, as well as of the exclusion· oia Form, some, as
I have pointed out in the notes on Aphs. 15 and· 16 of Book ii,
are vitiated through his ignoring this circumstance.

1 may remark, lastly, that the force of Bacon's argument is much
more apparent, as well as really greater, when stated affirmatively
than negatively. If the connection between two phenomena or
‘natures' satisfies all the requirements of the Inductive Methods (and,
on a liberal interpretation, we may regard all these requirements
as stated in Nov. Org. ii. 15), we are surely justified, without going
through any ‘exclusion' of other natures, in affirming a causal
relation between them. On the other ha'nd, however large the
number of ‘natures’ which we can succeed in excluding, we can
hardly ever be certain, in the present state of knowledge or any
which we are likely to attain, that we have excluded all but one.
And, even supposing we were able to attain this certainty, how do
we know, unless we have some positive evidence, that the remaining
nature is the cause or ‘ form' of the given nature? Might they not
both be, so far as our knowledge reaches, ultimate facts of nature,
uniformities of coexistence, like Inertia and Gravity⁴⁵i That Bacon
should have overlooked this objection to his method is the more
remarkable, when we take into account Aph. 48 of Book i, where he
