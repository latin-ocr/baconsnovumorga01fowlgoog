Inter praerogativas instantiarum, ponemus loco decimo

Thus, flame, being both a source of light and also itself a coloured
object, might properly be regarded asan ‘instantia foederis!

θ’· These are far the most celebrated of Bacon's ‘Praerogativae lnstan-
tiarum! Α ‘crucial instance’ has become a household word in the Eng-
lish language, and is, perhapS, far more widely used than any other technical
term of the Inductive Logic. According to the metaphor, there are two
or more ways before us, and the observation or experiment in question
acts as a ‘gulde-post’ (crux) in determining us which totale. We have
two or more rival hypotheses, which equally well accord with the facts
hitherto observed, and then we think of some decisive experiment or
observation, which, by according with one of the theories, and that only,
will enable us summurily to reject the others. One of the simplest
arrd most familiar examples is to be found in chemical processes, as where
we employ a rest for the purpose of determining the nature ofa particular
substance or of detecting the presence of a particular poison.

ln logical classiticadon, all crucial instances may be regarded as appli-
cations of the Method of Difference. All other circumstances being the
same, the appearance or disappearance, the existence or non-existence of
some one circumstance, or combination of circumstances, enables usto
determine the question at issue.

Α variety of examples of ‘instantiae crucis’ are adduced by myself in
my lnductive Logic (3rd Ed, pp. 148—151), by Professor Playfair in his
Preliminary Dissertation, by Sir John Herschel in his Discourse on the
Study of Natural Philosophy (ἧς ι96, 197, 218, 24⁶), and by Dr. Hippus in
his account of the Novum Organum, published by the Society for the Dif-
fusion of Useful Knowledge. To these l must refer the reader, as l have
space for one example only, which l take from Sir John Herschel:

‘The discovery of Torn'celli was, however, at first much misconceived,
and eren disputed, till the question was finally decided hy appeal to a crucia!
instance, one of tlre first, if not the very first orr record in physics‚ and
for which we are indebted to the celebrated Pascal. llis acuteness
perceived that if the weight of the incumbent air be the direct cause of
the elevation of the mercury, it must be measured by the amount of that
elevatior, and therefore that, by carrying a barometer up a high mountain,
and so ascending into the atmosphere above a large portion of the incum-
bent air, the pressure, as well as the length of the column sustained by it,
must be diminished; while, on the other hand, if the phenomenon were
due to the cause originally assigned, no difference could be expected to
trie place, whether the observation were made on a mountain or on
the plain. Perhaps the decisive effect of the experiment which he caused
