²³ ‘Auxiliary’

⁹⁴ So faras ‘Forma’ here=cause, ‘infallibiliter' must be taken with
the qualification, ‘unless there are counteracting circumstances?

’ὅ So far as ‘Forma'=cause, and ‘natura illa'=effect, Bacon is open
to the charge, made against him hy Mill, of having neglected to take into
consideration the fact of plurality of causes. The same cause (unless
there are counteracting circumstances) always produces the same effect,
hut the same effect may be due to different causes, as, for instance, death
to disease, poison or a shot·wound. See Mill's Logic, bk. iii. ch. 103 bk.
v. ch. 3. § 7. See also my Inductive Logic, 3rd Ed, pp. 6, 125, 1²7-30·

²⁸ See last note. The effect, in any particular instance, might be due to
a different cause, and would, therefore, not disappear.

²⁷ ‘Therefore, the form is always absent, when the given nature is
ahsent' (this is true), ‘and its absence always involves the absence of the
given nature’ (this is inaccurate3 see above), ‘and it is to he found in the
given nature only’ (this is true). My criticism, contained in the above
parentheses, applies, of course, only to the case in which form = cause.

²⁸ Here ‘form’ seems to be taken iu the sense of ‘vera differentia' (see
Aph. ι). The ‘ fons essentiae' spoken of below is regarded as the genus,
and the ‘natura data' as the species or tota essentia. The last is sup·
posed to be deduced from the fons essentiae by means of (or hythe
addition of) the form.

This passage is interesting, because it illustrates both the ambiguity of
the word ‘Form,’ and the close approximation or even ultimate identity
of its two meanings, as noticed in the Introduction, § 8. The ‘Fons
Essentiae’ may be regarded as the original substance capable of differen-
tiation, the ‘natura data' as the new substance produced from it, and the
‘form' either as the law governing the development of the one from the
other or as the sum of the attributes which, added to the original ‘es-
sentia’ constitute the ‘ natura data! Thus, let us suppose, for the sake
of example, that it would be possible to lind a menstruum, or common
substance, capable, by the addition of various differentiae, of becoming gold,
silver, copper, uc. The menstruum or common substance would represent
the fons essentiae, and gold, silver, ec. the naturae datae. Then, we
might describe the ‘form' either as the attributes which, added to the men·
struum, constitute the natura data, orasthe conditiora under which thenatura
