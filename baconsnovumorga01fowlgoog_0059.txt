earth’s motion. The reasons against the theory, probably, appeared
to him more and more decisive, till at last, with advancing age, he
became positive in his opposition to it. Now, surely, this is a pieoe
oi mental history so common, and one to which we are all, in turn,
so liable, that, before casting our stone at Bacon, we may at least
pause to consider the circumstances of his age, the attitude with
respect to the same question assumed by his contemporaries, and the
amount oi evidence by which the doctrine he reiected was at that time
supported. To parallel cases there is no limit, but 1 may specially
mention the tenacity with which tire Cambridge mathematicians ad·
hered to the Cartesian system long after the publication of Newton’s
discoveries (which, unlike those of Copernicus, possessed demon-
strative force), the slowness of their reception on the continent of
Europe, and the obstinate resistance offered by Leibnitz to the
Newtonian doctrine of Gravitarion⁸². Not only are we liable, as 1
have already intimated, to ascribe to a theory now fully established
a degree of perfectiori and an amount oi evidence which it did not at
first possess, and then express our surprise that it was not at once
universally welcomed, but we are also given to assume that the almost
superstitious reverence with which we now invest the great names of
the past ought to have exmcism an equal influence over their

contemporaries ⁰⁸.

Having dveit so long on the unfavourable side of the picture,
we may now turn rothe more agreeable taslr of considering the
positive claime of Bacon to recognition in the History of Science.
And, first, 1 must warn my readers against expecting too much.
Bacon, 1 have aclmowledged, was a Dilettante in science, and, there·

’¹ All these cases are mentioned in the last section of Playfair's Dissertation,
after his account of Newton's discoveries. He enters at some length on the two
former. For the last (which appears to me a much stronger ease of prejudice. in-
veteracy of habit, or whatever we lilre to call it, than that of Bacon), the reader
should referto the letters which passed between Clarke and Leibnita

'⁸ It has been frequently remarked that Bacon never mentions Kepler. It is pro·
hable, as Mr. Ellis remarks that he was not acquaiated with his writings, but the
mere omission oi his name would find at least a parallel in the case of Descarres.
who, though long posterior to Bacon. and having frequent occasion to treat of
astronomical questions, makes no reference to Kepler in any part of his writings.

1 may here take the opportunity of mentioning that the best account and criti·
cism of Bacon's astronomical views in detail is to be found in Mr. Ellis's Preface to
the Descriptio Globi intellectualis. vol. iii. pp. 715-726.
