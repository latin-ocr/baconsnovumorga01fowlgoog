LIB. II. 19. 395

camus eam, quae positiva reperitur in natura, nec
causatur a natura praecedente.

Sunt et aliae naturae: neque enim tabulas conficimus per-
fectas, sed exempla tanturn.
Omnes et singulae naturae praedictae non sunt ex forma
calidi. Atque ab omnibus naturis praedictis liberatur homo
in operatione super calidum.

Atque in exclusiva jacta sunt fundamenta inductiones verae,
quae tamen non perficitur donec sistatur in affirmativa.
Neque vero ipsa exclusiva ullo modo perfecta est, neque
adeo esse potest sub initiis. Est enim exclusiva (ut plane
liquet) rcy'ectzo naturarum simplicium⁹³. Quod si non habe-
amus adhuc bonas et veras notiones ⁹⁴ naturarum simplicium,
quomodo rectificari potest exclusiva? At nonnullae ex
supradictis (veluti notio naturae elementaris, notio naturae
coelestis, notio tenuitatis) sunt notiones vagae, nec bene
terminatae. Itaque nos, qui nec ignari sumus nec obliti
quantum opus aggrediamur (viz. ut iaciamus intellectum

chap. ii. Both Bacon and Locke, however, had already anticipated what
is now called the dynamical or mechanical theory of heat.

‘Baeon here anticipates not merely the essential character of the most
recent theory of beat, but also the kind of evidence by which it has been
established. The proof that caloric does not exist—in other words that
heat is not the manifestation of a peculiar substance diffused through
nature-rests mainly onexperiments of friction' Mr. Ellis' note.

⁸³ As opposed to concrete bodies, the forms of which are ‘formae
copulatae!

⁹⁴ But these are themselves to be gained by induetion. See Bk. i.
Aphs.14, 18, 40. The fact is that true axioms and sound notions are
interdependent and imply each other. ln Mathematics, the work of
delinitiou is elementary and comparatively easy, but in the Physical and
Moral Sciences, we must already have made considerable advances, before
we can begin to detine with any precision. Cp. note 99 on i. 59. Our
notions become clearer as we ascertain more facts, aud, as our notions
become clearer, the facts we collect or infer become more pertinent aud
more pregnant. Hence, l am inclined to think that Bacon did not con·
temptate two distinct kinds of induetiou, one for the clearing up of
conceptions and another for the establishment oi arrioms. Mr. Ellis,
however (see General Preface, vol. i. p. 37), is apparently of edisserent
oprnron.
