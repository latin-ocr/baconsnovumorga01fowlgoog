'⁸ There can be no question that Bacon is here alluding to the Method
of Exclusions, oi which he gives an instance in Blr. ii. Aph. 18. See note
68 on the ambiguous passage in Bk. i. Aph. ⁶9· The second of the altem·
ative explanations, which were there proposed, is, oi course, the one which
is applicable here.

The defects of Bacon's Method of Exclusion (sor a further account
oi which see q 9 of the Introduction to this edition and Mr. Ellis’s Preface
to Bucon's Philosophical Works, E. and S., voi. i. pp. ²2·39) are tolerably
obvious. There is, first, the difficulty, amounting, in most cases, almost to
impossrbility, oi ascertaining that all the possible explanations or causes
oi the given phenomenon have been paued in review. Then, again, we
not only require rules to exclude false theories, but also tests to satisfy
ourselves of the truth oi the theory which we ultimately adopt. These,
however, Bacon might have maintained, are, at least, suggested in ii. ι 5,
and, to acertain extent, supplied in some oi the Praerogativae l‘nstantiarum.

¹ But in the Temporis Partus Masculus (E. and S, vol. iii. p. 530) he
abuses Plato, amongst other things, for his induction, and apostrophises
him thus: ‘. . . . . . animosque vagis inductionibus tentares et exsolveres!
By the Platonic Induction in that and the present passage, he probably
means two different things. ln the Temporis Partus Masculus, he is
alluding probably to what is usually understood by the Platonic or Socratic
induction, the ἐπακτικοὶ λόγοι, or παραβολή, which (except in the fact that it
generally argues from a number oi instances, instead of generally arguing
from a single instance) answers to the Example of Aristotie or the Analogy
of modern Logic. For an account oi this mode of reasoning, see the
Introduction to Mansel's Edition of Aldrich, 4th ed, p. xx. But the ‘forma
inductionis' to which Bacon alludes in this Aphorism is undoubtedly the
Method of Exclusion, as practised by Plato. When he wishes to settle
the meaning of a term, his usual method (of which we may see an excellent
instance, with regard to δικαιοσύνη, in the rst boolr of the Republic) is
to bring lorward a number of interlocutos, who, one after the other, make
the attempt; each, in his turn, is refuted, generally by an application
of the Socratic nephtlali, or induction in the sense just described3 then,
the question is either left unsettled (as in the Euthyphron), or Socrates
himself proposes a definitior, which is accepted as final. But, ii the
affirmative Socrates stands his ground, it is only because, as Mr. Grote
says, there is no negative Socrates to eroes-question him. ln fact, this
allusion to the Platonic Metbod of Rejection brings into prominence the
objections to the method generally. How can we be certain that all
the possible delinitions have been started, and what guarantee have we
of the correctness of theone which is ultimately adopted?
