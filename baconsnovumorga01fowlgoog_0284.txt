Capienda etiam sunt signa ex incrementis et progressibus
philosophiarum et scientiarum. Quae enirn in natura fundata
sunt, crescunt et augentur: quae autem in opinione, variantur,
non augentur⁹⁵. Itaque si istae doctrinae plane instar plantae
a stirpibus suis revulsae non essent, sed utero naturae adhae-
rerent atque ab eadem alerentur, id minime eventurum
fuisset, quod per annos bis mille jam fieri videmus: nempe,
ut scientiae suis haereant vestigiis, et in eodem fere statu
maneant, neque augmentum aliquod memorabile sumpserint;
quin potius in primo authore maxime floruerint, et deinceps
declinaverint. In artibus autem mechanicistt, quae in natura

⁸⁵ This is one of Bacon's happiest thoughts. 1 may add that, if in any
subject we have a mere variatlon of opinion, without growth, it proves
either that the subject is incapable of scientific treatment, or else that the
scientitic mode of treating it has not yet been discovered. Thus, the
ontological problems, which constituted so large a part of the Greek
philosophy, did not, Ι conceive, admit of any scientitic solution, while
to much of the physical speculation of the Greek philosophers no scientific
treatment had yet been applied.
. It has often been brought as a charge against the moral and mental
sciences that they are a mere record of opinions, and admit of no growth.
Provided, however, to adopt Bacon’s language, they are ‘founded in
nature,’ that is to say, in the study of man and society, 1 believe this
charge to be emphatically untrue. The phenomena, indeed, are here
t more complex than in the physical sciences, and there is a larger amount
of uneducated opinion to be replaced by the results of scientitic investi-
gati0n; hence, undoubtedly, the process of growth is slower, but Ι believe
that with each generation of cultivated men, the materials for a knowledge
ot mind, life, aud conduct are surely accumulating, while scientific con·
ceptions, when once applied to these materials, admit of constant develop-
ment and further and further applications. lt may be added that in
these sciences, owing to the exceeding familiarity of the phenomena with
which they deal, there are certain early generalizations which it is com-
* paratively easy to make3 and hence, in the philosophies of Plato and
Aristotle, there isalarger amount of sound speculation in these departments
than in any others. But, though, perhaps, they are amongst the first
to blossom, they are the last to ripen.
