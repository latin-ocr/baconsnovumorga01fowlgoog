perlationes missilium, omnes fiunt itidem per tempora (quan-
tum ad summas) numerabilia. Calorem vero quod attinet,
videmus pueros per hyemem manus in flamma lavare, nec
tamen uri; et joculatores vasa plena vino vel aqua, per motus
agiles et aequales, vertere deorsum et sursum recuperare, non
effuso liquore; et multa hujusmodi. Nec minus ipsae com·
pressiones et dilatationes et eruptiones corporum fiunt, aliae
velocius, aliae tardius, pro natura corporis et motus, sed per
momenta certa. Quinetiam in explosione plurium bombard-
arum simul, quae exaudiuntur quandoque ad distantiam
triginta milliarium, percipitur sonus prius ab iis qui prope
absunt a loco ubi fit sonitus, quam ab iis qui longe ²⁶. At

eata quantitate, pro rata augeri aut multiplicari virtutem. Et hoc fere
postulant et supponunt, tanquam res sit mathematicae cujusdam certitu·
dinis; quod omnino falsissimum est. Globus plumbeus unius librae a turri
demissus (puta) decern pulsuum spatio ad terram descendit: num globus
duarum librarum (in quo impetus iste motus, quem vocant, naturalis dupli-
cari debet) spatio quinque pulsuum terram feriet? At ille aequali sere
tempore descendet, neque accelerabitur juxta rationem Quanti? These
passages, though Bacon makes no reference to Galile0, shew plainly enough
that he had given up the old Peripatetic and Scholastic doctrine (lor which
see my lnductive Logic, 3rd Ed, p. 2 56), that heayy bodies fall to the earth
in times inversely proportional to their weights, or, in other words, that
their velocitles are directly proportional to their weights. This doctrine,
though for a long time obstinately adhered to by his opponents‚ had been
exploded by Galileo by means of the experiments which he made from the
leaning tower of Pisa about r 590. He maintained (and rightly) that all
bodies, whatever their weight‚ would, if we could remove the resistance of
the air, fall through eqnal vertical spaces in equal times. See Dialogo dei
Massimi Sistemi, Giornata Seconda, Florentiae Ed. of 1842, rol. i. pp. ²45·
46; also Sermones de Motu Granium, vol. xi. pp. 48-9. The doctrine,
which Galileo combated‚ pleaded for itself the authority of Aristotle. See
the passage above quoted, and, with reference to the proportiou, De Coelo,
iii. a (p. 30¹ b. 1-17).

lt is almost superfluous to add that Bacon is right· in making the ‘ratio
medii’ an element in the enquiry. The differences in the velocities ol
bodies falling through the same vertical spaces are, in fact, entirely
deterrnined by the various media through which the bodies fall and the
different relations subsisting between the two.

²⁶ Cp. the very interesting passages on the motion and velocity of Sonnd
in Sylva sylvarum, Exps. «ογ-ι r, where Bacon proposes an experiment ior
the purpose of detennining the rate at which sound moves. ln principle,
the expet-imerii, which consists in comparing the time of seeing a light with
that ol hearing a sound, is the same as that from which the velocity ol
