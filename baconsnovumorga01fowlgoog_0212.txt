LIB. I. 2-7. 189

VI.

Insanum quiddam esset, et in se contrarium, existimare ea,
quae adhuc nunquam factasunt, fieri posse, nisi per modos
adhuc nunquam tentatos. ,

Generationes mentis et manus numerosae admodum viden-
turin libris et opificiis. Sed omnis ista varietas sita est in
subtilitate eximia, et derivationibus paucarum rerum, quae
innotuerunt3 non in numero axiomatumt.

the very time he wrote.-Mechanics had produced ily-cloelis, telescopes,
and other useful contrivances.--Mathematics boasted ol Kepler and Galileo;
aud the discoveries of Harvey aad Gilbert were opening out a new world
for Medical research. But Bacon could scarcely have discerned all this,
and his jealousy' (or, as l should rather say, distrust) ‘of his contem·
poraries (cf. l· 54) would scarcely have allowed him to achnowledge
their worth. Resides this he was utterly ignorant of Mathematics (see
Hallam, Lit. Eur. vol. 11. iii. 3. § 78). Alchemy was certainly thoroughly
empirical and saulty3 for “at this time Chemistry seemed to have an
elective attraction for everything that was absurd and unfoundcd.” (Play-
t‘air.) And Magic, which still exerted great influence, was as had. Sir
T. Browne‚ Rel. Med. i. 31, gives some account of it; which is worth
consulting as it gives the views of aphysieian and contemporary of Bacon.
Cf. also De Augm. Sc. iii. 5, and Adv. of Learning, Bk. ii!

ln Aph. 85, Bacon distinguishes between Natural and Superstitious
Magic. Natural Magic is treated in the De Augmentis, lib. iii. cap. 5, as
supplementary to the Inquisition of Forms, and vindicated‚ when dis-
tinguished from the ‘false and ignoble hind,' as a legitimate branchos
enquiry. ‘Si igitur desiderari eam partem Metaphysicae quae de Formis
agit posuimus, sequitur ut Naturalis etiam Magia, quae ad eam est relativa,
similiter desideretur. Verum hoc loco postulandum videtur, ut vocabulum
istud Magiae, in deteriorem partem jampridem acceptum, antiquo et
honorifico sensui restituatur. Etenim Magia apud Persas pro sapientia
sublimi, et scientia consensuum rerum universalium, accipiebatur; atque
etiam tres illi reges, qui ab Oriente ad Christum adorandum venerunt,
Magorum nornine vocabantur. Nos vero eam illo in sensu intelligimus,
ut sit scientia quae cognitionem Formarum Abditarum ad opera admiranda
deducat; atque, quod dici solet, activa cam passivis conjungendo magnalia
naturae manifestet!

The substance of this Aphorism, greatly expanded occupies the two
first paragraphs oi the Cogitata et Visa. These paragraphs arctoo long to
be extracted, but they may be read by the student with advantage. See
also F ilum Labyrinthi sive Formula inquisitionis, ad init. (E. and 8,
volitantium)-

iThe word Axioma is used by Bacon of any general proposition. ln
Aphorism103,llxiouiata are contrasted with ‘Opera' and ‘particularia'
