animalia perfecta et terrestria, per exectiones foetuum ex
nter0, minus humanum esset ista inquirere⁷⁷; nisi forte per

Varietate. Caesalpinus refers to the same instance, but less confidently
than Cardan. lt is worth remarking that Aristotle, though he speaks of
the great fecundity of mice, and even of their being impregnated by liching
salt, does not mention the possibility of their being produced by putrefac-
tion. (De Hist. Animal. vi. 37, Problem. x. 64.) Paracelsus, De Rerum
Generatione, affirms that all animals produced from putrefaction are more
or less venomous. Telesius' opinion is that the more perfect animala
cannot result from putrefaction, because the conditions of temperature
necessary to their production cannot be fullilled except by means of animal
heat' Mr.Ellis’ note.

A brief sumrnary of Aristotle’s opinions as to the origin of animal life is
given in the Historia Animalium, v. r (p. 539 a. ar-25): οὕτω καὶτῶν ζῴων
τὰ μὲν ἀπὸ ζῴων γίνεται κατὰ σιηγὲνειον τῆς μορφῆς, τὰ δ’ αὐτόματα καὶ οὐκ ἀπὸ
συγγενῶν, καὶτούτων rh μὲν e’rrv γῆς σηπομὲνης καὶ φυτῶν, ὥσπερ πολλὰ συμ-
βαίνει τῶν ἐντόμοον, τὰ δ’ ἐν τοῖς ζῴοις αὐτοῖς ἐκ τῶν ἐν τοῖς μορίοις περιπωμᾶ·
των. The subject of spontaneous generation frequently recurs both in the
Historia Animalium and in the De Generatione Animalium (see especially
i. 16 and iii. rr of the latter treatise). Amongst the most interesting points
of Aristotle’s doctrine are the theory that spontaneous generation is due to
the molsture which is found in putrefying matter (De Gen. An. iii. rr), and
the statement that cels are the only animals, possessing blood, which do not
arise either from congress or from eggs (Hist. An. vi. ιο). Mr. Lewes has
some good remarks on Aristotle's doctrine in his ‘Aristotle,' pp. 364-6.

Bacon does not seem to have entertained any doubt as to the generation
of animals frorn putrefaction. Cp. Sylva Sylvarum, Exps. 328, 9003 His·
toria Densi et Rari (E. and 8., vol. ii. p. 2⁶4). Sir Thomas Browne in his
Enquiries into Vulgar and Common Errors (first published in 1646) appears
to receive the doctrine with as little questioning. See, for'instance, bh. ii.
ch. 6: ‘So when the ox corrupteth into bees, or the horse into hornets,
they corne not forth in the image of their originals. So the corrupt and
excrementitious humour-s in men are animated into lice,' and more to the
same effect. He even seems to believe in the equivocal generation of
mice (blr. iii. ch. 28). These theories were all but finally disposed of by
Harvey in his great Treatise, De Generatione Animalium‚ first published in
1⁶51. There he maintains the thesis ‘Ovum esse primordium commune

omnibus animalibus!
Π And yet it is plain from the New Atlantis that Bacou did not object

to vivisection. See the passage (E. and S, vol. iii. p. 159), beginning with
the following remarkable sentences: ‘We have also parhs and inclosures
of all sorts of beasts and birds, which we use not only for view or rareness,
but likewise for dissections and trials3 that thereby we may taire light
what may be wrought upon the body of man. Wherein we find many
strange effects3 as continuing life in thern, though divers parts, which you
account vital, be perished and talen forth3 resuscitating of some that seem
