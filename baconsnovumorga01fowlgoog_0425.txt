402 NOVUM ORGANUM.

enim celeriorem fore refrigerationem ad extremitates in
eo bacillo ubi nix ponitur supra quam in eo ubi nix
ponitur subter: contra ac fit in calido

Tertia differentia ea est; ut calor sit motus, non ex-
pansivus uniformiter¹⁵ secundum totum, sed expansivus
per particulas minores corporis; et simul cohibitus et
repulsus et reverberatus adeo ut induat motum alter·
nativum1⁰ et perpetuo trepidantem et tentantem et niten-
temet ex repercussione irritatum3 unde furor ille ignis
et caloris ortum habet.

Ista vero differentia ostenditur maxime in flamma et
liquoribus bullientibus3 quae perpetuo trepidant, et in
parvis portionibus tument, et rursus subsidunt.

Ostenditur etiam in iis corporibus, quae sunt tam durae
compagis ut calefacta aut ignita non intumescant aut
dilatentur mole3 ut ferrum ignitum¹⁷, in quo calor est
acerrimus.

Ostenditur etiam in hoc, quod per frigidissimas tem-
pestates focus ardeat acerrime¹⁸.

¹³ That is to say, some particles are heated before others, and, con·
sequently, the whole mass is, at any given time, heated unequally in its
different parts. This circumstance does not, however, prevent the expan-
sion of the body as a whole, which must be a necessary consequence of the
expansion of even a portion of its constituent particles. See note 7 above.

¹⁶ This description seems to be a remarkable anticipation of the Undu·
larory Theory of Heat. Cp. Tyndall, Heat a Mode of Motion, § 339:
‘Let us now revert for a moment to our fundamental conceptions regard-
ing radiant heat. lts origin is an oscillatory motion of the ultimate par-
ticles of matter—a motion taken up by the ether, and propagated through
itin waves. The particles of ether in these waves do not oscillate in the
same manner as the particles of air, in the case of sound. The air-particles
move to and fro, in the direction in which the sound travels; the ether
particles move to and fro, across the line in which the light travels. The
undulations of the air are longitudinal, those of the ether transversal.
The ether waves resemble more the ripples of water than they do the
abrial pulses which produce sound!

¹⁸ See note on Aph. 13, Inst. 36.

Bacon’s theocles are in advance of his proofs. Most of the instances
collected under this ‘Third Differentia' are of little, if any, value towards
proving the conclusion.
