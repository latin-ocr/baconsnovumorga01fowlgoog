Nec manus nuda, nec intellectus sibi permissus, multum
valet; instrumentis et auxiliis res perficitur3 quibus opus
est, non minusad intellectum,'quam ad manum. Atque ut
instrumenta manus motum aut cient aut regunt3 ita et in·
strumenta mentis intellectui aut suggerunt aut cavent.

III.

Scientia et potentia humana in idem coincidunt²‚ quia
ignoratio causae destituit effectum. Natura enim non nisi
parendo vincitur³: et quod in contemplatione instar causae
est, id in operatione instar regulae est

IV.

Ad opera nil aliud potest homo, quam ut corpora natu·
ralia admoveat et amoveat: reliqua natura intus transigit ⁴.

Solent se immiscere naturae (quoad opera ὅ) mechanicus,
mathematicus, medicus, alchemista‚ et magus3 sed omnes (ut
nunc sunt res) conatu levi, successu tenuit.

² The same thought is often brieily expressed iu English under the

plications of science. Professor Playfair truly remarks that the wantos
connection between the sciences and arts was one of the principal defects
which Bacon deplored in the philosophy of his time. .

over her operations. Our ‘rules’ are merely copies and adaptations‘of the
‘causes’ which we see at work in the external world. The same sentence,
slightly altered, is repeated in hpborism ¹²9· See note on itin that place.

⁴ We cannot create; we can only combine or separate bodies already
existing. ‘ln Art,' says Playfair, ‘man does nothing more than bring
things nearer to one another, or carry them farther otl; the rest is
performed by Nature, and on most occasions by means of which we

⁰ So sar as concerns the active or operative part of knowledge, that is to
