Instantius solitariae. Eae autem sunt solitariae, quae exhi·
bent naturam de qua fit inquisitio in talibus subjectis, quae nil
habent commune cum aliis subjectis, praeter illam ipsam
naturam; aut rursus quae non exhibent naturam de qua fit
inquisitio in talibus subjectis, quae sunt similia per omnia curn
aliis subjectis, praeterquam in illa ipsa natura. Manifestum
enim est quod hujusmodi instantiae tollant ambages, atque
accelerent et roborent exclusivum ‘¹³‚· adeo ut paucae ex illis

, sint instar multarum.

stantiae Solitariae sunt prismata, gemmae chrystallinae, quae
reddunt color'es non solum in se sed exterius supra parietem,

quae per ambages et flexus secet, ex indiciis nostris innotescat! ‘ltaque
docebimus primo‚’ he goes oa to say, ‘quales sint illae instantiae, sive
experimenta, quae ad illuminationem prae caeteris excellant, adeo ut
paucae idem quod aliae plures praestent. Hoc enim et moli ipsius bis·

³⁹ Bacon could hardly have commenced with a more promising example
of his ‘ prerogatives.' lt is curious that the two divisions of the ‘instantiae
solitariae' correspond respectively with Mill's Methods of Agreement and
Difference. To quote what 1 have said elsewhere (Inductive Logic, 3rd
Ed, p. ¹4⁶l² ⁴ ln the Method 01 Difference, the instances agree in every·
thing, except in the possession of two circumstances which are present in
the one instance and absent in the other. ln the Method of Agreement
the various instances compared (for here we generally require more than
two instances) agree in nothing, except in the possession 01 two circum·
stances which are common to all the instances.' Here, 01 course, the
‘two circumstances’ are the ‘natura de qua 101 inquisitio’ and the assigned
cause. The cogency 01 these methods is almost evident from the state·
ment 01 thern. ‘The Method 01 Agreement‚' says Mr. Mill, ‘stands 00
1100 ground that whatever can be eliminated, is not connected with the
phenomenon by any law. The Method of Difference has for 110 foundation
that whatever can not be eliminated, is connected with the phenomenon by
alaw! ⁴

³³ The second division, answering to the Method of Difference, does
more than this. 11 110 conditions were 00010011)Γ satisfied, it would demon-
strate the truth of the assigned cause.

³* Bacon is no less happy in his example than in his rule. ‘He con·
cludes‚' says Professor Playfair, ‘that colour is nothing else than a modi·
fication 01 1100 rays 01 light, produced, in the first case, by the different
degrees 01 incidence; and, in the second, by the texture or gannitution 01

on these examples; 100 11 was by means 01 them that Newton afterwards
found out the composition of light:
