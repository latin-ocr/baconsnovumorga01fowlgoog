more serious notice. As, however, the topics which they start are,
for the most part, dealt with elsewhere, either in the Introduction or
in the notes to this Edition, I shall here confine myself to a very
brief notice of them.

ln his Life of Newton (1855)⁶⁸, Sir D. Brewster, irritated apparently
by the injudicious statement of ‘some modern writers of celebrity,’
that Newton ‘owed all his discoveries to the application of the
principles of Bacon,' maintains a proposition equally extreme, and,
as it seems tome, equally untrue, that he did not ‘derive the slightest
advantage from Bacon's precepta! For what 1 conceive to be a
refutation of this position, l must refer the reader back to what l
have aheady said on the relation of Newton to Baconv. Taking
occasion of this incidental mention of Bacon, Brewster goes on to
combat his claims generally as a reformer of science. He argues,
or rather asserts (for, except of the first proposition, be adduces
hardly any proof): rst, that ‘the necessity of experimental research,
and of advancing gradually from the study of facts to the determina·
tion of their cause, is a doctrine which was not only inculcated‚ but
successfully followed by preceding philosophers 5' and, that no
testimonies to the value of Bacon's method have been offered by
those who have actually cultivated science; 3rd, that, as regards
his own investigation into the nature of beat, ‘the oracle which he
had himself established refused to give its responses, and the minister·
ing priest was driven with discomfiture from his shrine3' 4th, that
‘a collection of scientific facts are of themselves incapable of leading
to discovery, unless they contain the predominating fact or relation
in which the discovery mainly resides? Briefly to reply to these
assertions, the first is, within certain limits and with certain explana-
tions, which, however, require to be given, undoubtedly true; the
second 1 conceive that 1 have already abundantly disproved; as
to the third, 1 believe that the ‘ministering priest' obtained a far
more luminous answer than oracles are usually in the babit of giving ;
with regard to the last, if Sir D. Brewster means that a mere collection
of facts, without any play of the mind upon them (‘permissio intel·
lectus,' as Bacon phrased it, or, as we should say in technical language,
formation of hypotheses), is seldom or never lilrely to lead to dis-
covery, 1 cordially agree with him, but then Bacou himself, we must
recollect, was happily inconsistent on this point. Brief as is Sir D.
Brewster’s notice of Bacon, it deserves considerable attention, because
