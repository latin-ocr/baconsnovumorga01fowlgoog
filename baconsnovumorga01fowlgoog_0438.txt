Etenim flamma, licet manifesto exhibeat expansionem, tamen
propter momentaneam extinctionem non ostendit progressum
expansionis. Aqua autem fervens, propter facilem transitionem
aquae in vaporem et ae'rem, non tam bene ostendit expansionem
aquae in corpore suo. Rursus serrum ignitum, et similia, tan·
tum abest ut progressum ostendant, ut contra per retusionem
et fractionem spiritus per partes compactas et crassas (quae
domant et fraenant expansionem) ipsa expansio non sit omnino
conspicua ad sensum⁶². At vitrum calendare clare ostendit
expansionem in aere, et conspicuam et progredientem et
durantem, neque transeuntem ⁶³.

Rursus exempli gratia, sit natura inquisita Pondus. In-

enim superat pondere magno intervallo praeter aurum3 quod
non multo gravius est⁵⁵. At praestantior instantia est ad

bedded in masses of the most solid rock, and often on the tops of very
high mountains.’ Playfair, Preliminary Dissertation.

‘The laws of crystallography were obscure, and its causes still more so,
till Haiiy fortunately dropped a beautiful crystal of calcareous spar on a
stone ipavement, and brolre it. In piecing together the fragments, he
observed their facets not to correspond with those of the crystal in its
entire state, but to belong to another form3 and, following out the hint
offered bya “glaring instance” thus casually obtruded on his notice, he
discovered the beautiful laws of the cleavage and the primitive forms of
minerals.’ Herschel's Discourse, &c.,§ 191.

ln § 3⁶5 of the same book, Herschel adduces Magnetism as a ‘glaring
instance' of polarity, ‘and that under circumstances which peculiarly adapt
it for the study of this quality!

⁶² This almost loolrs as if he thought that ignited iron, &c., do undergo
expansion‚ though the amount of it is imperceptible to us. Cp. Aph. 18,
Inst. 10.

³⁵ ‘And without passing beyond the condition of air;’ as water, for
instance, transcends its own condition, when it is converted into steam.

Μ Dr. Hippus (Accouut of the Novum Organum, in the Library of
Useful Knowledge, pt. ii. p. 16) points out that Bacon is not happy in his
selection of this instance: ‘for gold, which is heavier than quichsilver,
becomes fluid also by the application of heat; aud quiclrsilver is solid at a
certain temperatura}

⁸⁶ Bacon commits the same mistalre in the Historia Densi et Rari. He
there makes the Specitic Gravity of Quiclrsilver to that of Gold as 19 Den.
9Gr. to 20 Den., that is as 19¹375 to πο. (E. and S, vol. ii. p. 245.) The
true ratio is 13·598 to 19·258 of Cast Gold or 19·362 of Stamped Gold,
taking the specific gravity of all these substances at zero, as compared with
