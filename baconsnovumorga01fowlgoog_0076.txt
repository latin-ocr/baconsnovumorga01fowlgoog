hand, to question the authority oi the Scriptores and the first truths
os Christianity, or, on the other hand, to allow them to exert any
influence on his philosophical speculatione. Bayle tries to exaggerate -
the discrepancies, but, not having the robust saith of Bacon or Loclre,
he seems, with some hesitation, ready to sacrifice the claime oi
religious belief to the exigencies of human reason. But, however
it may bave been with particular individuals, 1 cannot question that
the general tendcncy‚ predominant, especially in England‚ till quite
recently‚ to drawa distinct line oi demarcation between the spheres
of religion, on the one side, and philosophy and seleuce, on the
other, and to combine a sincere belief in the traditional teaching oi
the Bible or the Churcb with a perfect independence in the sphere
oi speculation, is due, in very large measure, to the teaching and
example oi Bacon. Whether this procedure be or be not legitimate,
this is not the place to enquire ²⁹.

What Bacon precisely means by this word ‘Form,' is one oi the
first questions which must occur to every reader oi the Novum
Organum, and itis probably one of the last difficulties which will

sions, many ol which agree with his, had almost all been previously arrived at by
an independent study oi Bacon's writings.

¹⁰ For the sake oi those who are unacquainted‚ or have onlya slight acquaintance,
with the philosophy oi Aristotle, it is, perhaps, desirable that l should here give a
briei account of the Aristotelian distinction of the Four Causea. These are popu·
larly known aa the Material, Formal, Final, and Efficient Causes. Their Greelr
equivalents are respectively: lor the Material Cause, r) ὕλη or ro ἐξ οὗ or rd
&acciperem ior the Forma] Cause, τὸ eidos or r> μορφή or τὸ rl ἦν eirca or τὰ
el lora or r) odoia: sor the Final Causa, τὸ ori ἕνεκα or ro* vtro· ἕνεκα or τὸ
’πέλοις for the Efficient Cause, τὸ ὅθεν ἠ ἀρχὴ rtis κινήσεωι ot· τὸ ὅθεν ἡ κίνησω
or τὸ κινοῦν. Os these. the Formal and Material Caase can only be known in
relation to each other: thus, the bloclr oi marble, which is matter in relation
to the formed statue, itseli has form in relation to the quarry from which it
was hewm aud this again in relation to the stuff out os which it was formed,
and so on, till we come to the πρώτη ὕλη or shapeless matter or matter
without form, which, however, is a mere mental abstraction, having no actual
existence. Nor is matter necessan'ly body. Thus (Phys. 11. 3), letters are the
matter oi syllables, aud the premissos the matter oia syllogism. It is simply
that on which iorm supervenes (τὸ τίνων ὄντων ἀνάγκη τοῦτο, sc. the form, εἶναι.
