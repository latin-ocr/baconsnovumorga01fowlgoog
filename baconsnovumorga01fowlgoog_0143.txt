120 INTRODUCTION.

was quite out of the power of our limited faculties‚ the Lord Bacon
v judiciously observes to be the great obstruction to the progress of
science. lndeed that excellent person was the first who expressly
writ against this way of philosophising; and he has laid open at
large the absurdity of it in his admirable treatise, intitled Novum
Organon Sct‘enlrhrum ,· and has there likewise described the true
method, which ought to be followed! He then goes on to give
a copious account ofsome portions of the First Book of the Novum
Organum, especially of the ‘Duo viae' (Aph. 19) and the ‘Idola'
and then continues: ‘But what surprizing advancements in the
knowledge of nature may be made by pursuing the true course in
philosophical enquiries, when those searches are conducted by a
genius equal to so divine a work, will be best understood by con·
sidering Sir isaac Newton’s discoveries.’ In attempting to give an
account of the ‘principles whereon Sir lsaac Newton proceeds,' the
author evidently has Bacon's method constantly in view, and, in
expuunding the third uf the ‘Regulae Philosophandi,’ he again
mentions him hy name: ‘The only caution here required is * * * * *
as the Lord Bacon very judiciously directs.’ Now, supposing Newton
to have seen this Introduction, as seems very probable, the controversy
may be regarded, 1 think, as determined, and we may, at least,
conclude that Newton would have been ready to ackuowledge his
obligations to the precepts and wamingS, contained in the First Book
of the Novum Organum

Machurin, again, in his Account of Sir Isaac Newton's Philoso-
phical Discoveries (published after his death, in 1748), evidently
regards the connection between Bacon and Newton as a very close
one. The whole of his remarks on Bacon are well worth attention
(see pp. 56-62). 1 can only give one or two brief extracts. ‘Sir
Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam, who was cotemporary with Galileo
and Kepler, is justly held amongst the restorers of true learning, but
more especially the founder of experimental philosophy.¹ * * ⁴* * *
‘He proposed his plan in his Instauratrh Magna, with so much
strength of argument, and so just a acal, as renders that admirable
work the delight ol all who have a teste lor solid learning.’ * * ³ * *
In his Novum Organum ‘his chief design is to shew how to make
a good inductiou, as Aristotle's was to teach how to make agood
syllogism. Had the philosophem, since Lord Verulam's time, adhered
more closely to his plan, their success had been greater ; and Sir
Isaac Newton’s philosophy bad not found the learned so full of
prejudices against it, in favour of some systems lately invented and
