Inter praerogativas instantiarum ponemus loco decimo
septimo Instantias Citantes⁴²‚ sumpto vocabulo aforis civi-
libus, quia citant ea ut compareant quae prius non comparu-
erunt; quas etiarn Instantius Evocantrs appellare consuevimus
Eae deducunt non-sensibile ad sensibile.

Sensum autem fugiunt res, vel propter distantiam objecti
locati⁴³; vel propter interceptionem sensus per corpora median
vel quia objectum non est habile ad impressionem in sensu
faciendam3 vel quia deficit quantum in objecto pro feriendo
sensu; vel quia tempus non est proportionatum ad actuandum
sensum; vel quia objecti percussio non toleratur a, sensu; vel
quia objectum ante implevit et possedit sensum, ut novo motui
non sit locus. Atque haec praecipue ad visum pertinent, et
deinde ad tactum. Nam hi duo sensus sunt informativi ad
largum, atque de communibus objectis ⁴⁴ 3 ubi reliqui tres non
informent fere, nisi immediate et de propriis objectis.

⁴² ‘The instantiae citantes enable us to percelve things which ane in
themselves insensible, or not at all the objects of perception. They cite or
place things, as it were, before the bar of the senses, and from this anology
to judicial proceedings is derived the name of instantiae citantes. Such, to
employ examples which the progress of science has unfolded since the time
of Bacon, are the air-pump and the barometer for manifesting the weight
and elasticity of air; the measurement oi the velocity of light, by means
of the eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter, and the aberration of the fixed
stars; the experiments in electricity and galvanism, and in the greater pert
oi pneumatio chemistry. ln all these instances things are made known
which before had entirely escaped the senses! Playfair's Preliminary
Dissertation.

⁴⁸ The first and fourth of these cases are, at first sight, hardly distinguish-
able from the ‘ Instantiae Januae! But, when we come to the examples,

' we find that Bacon has in mind objects which cannot be known in them·

selves but can be known only by means of indications, whereas in the
‘instantiae januae' the objects themselves can be detected, provided we
have sufficiently powerful instrumente.

‘⁴ The impressione of sight and touch are so intimately associated, that,
in most cases, one isan index of the other. The student will not fail to
recall, in connection with this subject, Berkeley’s New Theory of Visiou
as applied to the acquired perceptions of Sight and the numerous kindred
