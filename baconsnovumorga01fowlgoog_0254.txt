ΜΒ. Ι. 60. 231

generum sunt¹3 aut enim sunt rerum nomina, quae non sunt ·
(quemadmodum enim sunt ree, quae nomine carent per in-
observationem2; ita sunt et nomina, quae carent rebus, per
suppositionem³ phantasticam), aut sunt nomina rerum, quae
sunt, sed confusa et male terminata, et temere et inaequaliter*
a rebus abstracta. Prioris generis sunt, fortuna⁵‚ primum
mobile ⁶, planetarum orbes ⁷, elementum ignis ⁸, et hujusmodi

¹This division of the ldola Fori is important. Sometimes we are
deceived by words expressing supposed entities which have no actual
existence3 sometimes by words which inadequately or erroneously represent
actually existing things or properties.

² Thus, Naturalists are constantly inventing new names sor newly dis·
covered species or varieties. The reader os Aristotle's Ethics will recollect
several moral states which Aristotle describes, but designates as nameless.
lt hardly needs to be observed that, as a science advances, it finds names
lor these ‘nameless' things or qualities.

³ This word may here be used in its technical sense, for which see
Sanderson's Logic, bk. ii. ch. a.

⁴ Cp. Aph. 41, ‘Estque intellectus' etc. We might translate inaequaliter
as ‘partially.’ Due care has not been given to the patient examination of
all the cases with all their attendant circumstances, and to the abstraction
ol all disturbing influences in the human mind itself.

⁵ Thus, one oi the dicta ascribed to Anaxagoras is that Fortune (τύχη)
is nothing more than a cause undiscovered by human reasoning, ἄδηλος
αἰτία ἀνθρωπίνῳ λογισμῷ. Cp. Juvenal, Sat. x. 365-6:

‘Nullum numen habes, si sit prudentia: nos te
Nos facimus, Fortuna, deam coeloque locamus!

⁸ ln the ancient systems ol Astronomy, the heavens were supposed to
consist os a number of hollow and concentric crystalline spheres revolving
at different rates of velocity round the earth, and carrying with them the
stars and planete. The ⁴ primurn mobile’ was the outerrnost sphere of the
Universe, in some systems identified with, in others distinguished from,
the coelum stellatum or sphere containing the lixed stars. It was regarded
as communicating a motion to all the other spheres, apart from their proper
or independent motion, and with them revolving round the earth once in
twenty-four hours.

⁷ These are the spheres in which the planets were supposed to be set, and
by which they were supposed to be carried round the earth, each with its
own peculiar motion. ΜΓ. Kitchin quotes Milton, Paradise Lost, v. 176:

‘The lixed stars, fixed in their orb that illes!

There was supposed to be a similar sphere, externa] to the others, in
which tbe fixed stars were set. See last note. The reader os Plato’s
Republic will remembera curious illustration os these crude astronomical
theories in the Myth of Er at the end ot* the tenth Boolr.

⁸ See note 61 on Aph. 45.
