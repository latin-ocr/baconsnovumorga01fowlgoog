88 INTRODUCTION.

autem non habentes sensum, impossibile est. Singularium enirn
sensus est; nec contingit ipsorum accipere scientiam, neque ex uni-
versalibus sine inductione, nec per inductionem sine sensu. Fit ergo
ex sensu memoria; ex memoria multorum saepius iterata, experi-
mentum; ab experimentis scientiae aut artis ratio manat. Porro ab
arte, quae usu et exercitatione firmata est, provenit facultas ex·
sequendi ea, quae ex arte gerenda sunt. Sic itaque sensus corporis,
qui prima vis, aut primum exercitium animae est, omnium artium

Ι praejacit fundamenta; et praeexistentem sonnat cognitionem, quae

primis principiis viam non modo aperit, sedet parit' ‘Planum autem
est hoc diligentius inspicienti per singula. Nam cum sensus, secun·
dum Aristotelem, sit naturalis potentia indicativa rerum, aut omnino
non est, aut vix est cognitio, deficiente sensu!

Fertile, however, as these principles might have been in a different
age, it must be confessed that they bore little fruit in the time ol
which 1 am speaking. It was only men oi rare curiosity or of a
singular love oi nature, like Albert the Great⁸⁹ or our own Roger
Bacon, who saw the supreme importance of interrogating laets or oi
rearing science upon experience. To the latter ol these great names
⁸ Ι shall devote some little space.

Pirst, however, Ι may remark, by way of parenthesis, that Dr.
Whewell¹ discovers certain resemblances between the mediaeval
mystic, Richard oi St. Victor (died 1¹⁷3) and Francis Bacon. Oi
these, the most important is the dictum that ‘ Physica] science ascends
from effects to causes, and descends again from causes to ellects².'
This, however, appears to me to be one oi those incidental utterances
which might easily be made without perceiving, as Bacon undoubtedly
did perceive, its scientific value or the practical consequences to
which, il properly developed, it would lead.

The comparison os the speculations oi Roger Bacon (who wrote
towards the end oi the thirteenth century) with those of his namesake
are specially interesting, and have been made much ol by those who
deny or depreciate the originality of the latter ⁸. The whole spirit oi

’⁰ Agood account oi the physical speculations oi this philosopher will be found
in Pouehet, Histoire des Sciences Naturelles au Moyen Age, and os his relation to
the Scholastic controversies in Haurdau, De la Philosophie Scolastique, chs. 17-19.

tractat de invisibilibus visibilium causis¹

other writers, who have handled the same subject.
