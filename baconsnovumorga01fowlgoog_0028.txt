INTRODUCTION.

i 2. ou rus oancr or rura novun ononrvvru.

The objectos the Novum Organum, and of Bacon's philosophy
in general, is, stated summarily, to enlarge the dominion of man,
‘Regnum Hominis' as he phrases it, by increasing his knowledge
oi Nature and his power over her operations. This end can only
be accomplished, he conceives‚ by ireeing the mind from its false
prejudioes‚ especially its habit of blind submission to authority, and
thus bringing it iace to lace with the laets ol Nature. But these facts
are themselves of little use, unless siited, compared, and employed as
stepping-stones to generalisations from which other facts can be legiti-
mately deduced Hence, the need ol a new method of Induction,
which shall not merely accumulate but select instances on certain
rational principles, draw legitimate inferences from them, and thus
guarantee the truth oi those first principles from which our deductive
reasoning proceeds This more scientihc iorrn ol Induction it is
more especially the aim oi the Novum Organum to supply, but,
previously to laying down any rules ior it or exempliiying its ern-
ployment, it is necessary to insist on its importance, to sree the
mind from those obstacles which might prevent it from having
recourse to this assistance, to point out the sources ol our errors
in the past, and to shew what hopes may be conceived ol the future.
The preliminary task is undertaken in Book I. The formal ex-
position ol the method begins in Book ll, but the work, as lest by
liaconis not completed.

This brief summary may be usesul to the student, and, therefore,
1 place it at the head os the introduction. But it appears to me
undesirable to expand it, as, otherwise,1 should be anticipating the
words os my author as wellas rendering necessary several explana·
tione which would now needlessly delay and weary the reader, but
which 1 shall offer lrom time to time, in their proper place, as the
work proceeds.
