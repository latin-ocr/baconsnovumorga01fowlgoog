INTRODUCTION. 41

Amongst Bacon's claims to the recognition oi scientific men, a
high place ought to be given to his felicitous illustration ol the
‘Instantiae Solitariae¹⁰' by the enquiry into the causes os Colour.
The passage, to which, with my notes upon it, lmust refer the reader,
might justly be regarded as a striking anticipation oi the optical
investigatione, afterwards so deservedly celebrated, ol Newtoru

In connection with the same subject, I may reier to some inter·
esting speculations on the phenomena oi Retraction in Sylva Sylvarum,
Erps. 761, 762.

Both M. Bouillet and lllr. Ellis rightly call attention to the import-
ance os an experiment, tried with a hollow globe oi lead, by which
Bacon attempted to determine the question of the compressibility or
incompressibility of water¹¹. This experiment has every appearance
oi having been original, and certainly preceded by nearly fifty years
the celebrated experiment of a similar nature, usually called the
Florentine experiment, made by the Accademia del Cimento at
Florence. Both experiments were, as we now lrnow, inconclusive‚
but this does not detract from the ingenuity oi conception which
suggested them.

Humboldt (Kosmos, vol. ii. pp. 322, 379, 380) compliments Bacon
on having in his Historia Ventorum (which Humboldt dates much too
late) considered the direction oi the winds in connection with tem-
peratura and aqueous phenomena, and having thereby laid the
foundations oi a theory of the currents oi the atmosphere.

Again, we find, scattered here and there in Bucon’s works, pro·
found views os nature, which recent science has done rnuch to
illustrate and confirm. Such is the implied criticism oi the ordinary
doctrine oi species contained in the passage on Realism in N ov. Org.
i. 66. Such, too, is the opinion on the ultimate constitution oi
bodies expressed in his atomio theory¹², and that on the ultimate
condition oi their parts expressed towards the end oi Nov. Org.
ii, 48: ‘Etenim in corporibus hic apud nos nulla vera est quies, nec in
integris, nec in partibus; sed tantum secundum apparentiam? And,
to give one more instance, there is shown throughout his worlrs a

¹¹ See Nor. Org. ii. 45, 50 (a); Historia Densi et Rari (E. and S, vol. ii.
pp. 299, 300). From these passages it appears that Bacon thought he had demon·
atrated the compressibility ol water. From the F lorentine experiment, so sar as
any conclusion at all was dmwn, it was the opposite one. On the subject generally,
