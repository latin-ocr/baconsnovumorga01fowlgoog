118 INTRODUCTJON.

‘At my request a young Oxonian prepared me a list of fit, capable,
and bopeful persons, addicted to the design of the Royal Society, and
willing to entertain correspondencies, and to assist in them. They
seemed to me by their qualifications, and number, very considerable ;
some in every college, and in every hall. Only in one college, there
was but one named ; but it is excused, that his list was much too
short, and that he wanted time to complete it, and for some reasons
he would not be seen to advise with others for fuller information.
There are excellent professore, some lecturers, and very many students
of useful arts amongst them. And in time they may have their
mcetings in some of their publick schools, after fit lectures; and the
wings of the Stubbians are already broken, and their reputation
wrthen, as Dr. Bathurst told me! Boyle's Works, Ed. of 1744,
vol. v. p. 498, b.

Mr. Napier, to whom l arn indcbted for the two next references,
thinks that the ‘new philosophy' had made still greater progress at
Cambridge. This conclusion is based mainly on a passage in Antony
Wood (Bliss’s ed. of the Athenae Oxonienses, 1817, vol. iii. p. 1244),
who, in his Life of Glanvill, ‘wonders considering that that house
[Exeter College] was then one of the chief nurseries for youth in
the university, why he should afterwards lament that his friends did
not first send him to Cambridge, because, as he used to say, that
new philosophy and the art of philosophising were there more than
here in Orion, and that his first studies in this university did not
, qualify him for the world of action and business! This evidence,
which Ι have thought better to give in full, may not be of much
value as settling the claims of the rival Universities‚ but, at all events,
it is sufficient to shew that Cambridge had already a reputation for
the ‘new philosophy! Of this, perhaps, we receive additional testi-

mony in Baker's Reflections upon Learning, first published in 1699.
This author was a Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge, 'and
¹is now well known for his history of that College, recently published
and edited by ΜΓ. Mayor. In the former work (Chapter on Logic),

after making some interesting remarks on the *Method of Bacon, he
proceeds: ‘After the way of free thinking’ (notice, again, this ex-
pression) ‘had been lai'd open by my Lord Bacon, it was soon after
greedily follow'd, for the Understanding affects Freedom as well as
the Will, and men will pursue liberty, tho it ends in confusion! p. 59.
This reflection, however, may have simply a general reference, and

may not have been specially suggested by the experience of the
writer's own University.
