Of English Translations of the Novum Organum, Peter Shaw’s
(which has been frequently reprinted) first appeared in 1725, in his
English Edition of Bacon's works. One made by Mr. W. Wood was
embodied in Montagu's Edition (London Pickering, 1831), and
re-printed by Pickering in a separate form in 1844, and, again, in
Bohn's Series (Ed.Devey),1853. A translation of the First Book
only was printed for private circulation by Mr. Glassford‚ Edinburgh¹
1844. Mr. Kitchin's Translation appeared in 1855 (Oxford Clarendon
Press), Mr. Headlam's in the 4th vol. of Ellis and Spedding’s Edition,
1858, and, lastly, Mr. Andrew Johnson's <uer and Daldy) in 1859.

It should be noticed that an English epitome of the Novum Orga-
num ‘translated and taken out of the Latin by M.D. B.D.’ was
published in 1676 at the end of the tenth Edition of the Sylva
sylvarum, and was reprinted in the subsequent editions of that
work.

Of published French Translations, 1 can speak‚ from personal
inspection“‚ only of those of Lasalle (OEuvres de Franpois Bacon,
Chancellier d'Angleterre, traduites par Α. Lasalle‚ Dijon, An 8 [r8oo]),
and of Μ. Lorquet‚ which contains only Book i. and portions of
Book ii. The latter work, which is bound up with extracta from
Descartes and Leibnitz‚ is an Ouvrage autorise par la conseil royal
de l'instruction‚ and was published at Paris in 1847.

In the Pantheon Litteraire, there is a collection of the OEuvres
Philosophiques‚ Morales, et Politiqnes de Francois Bacon in French
by J. A. C. Buchon‚ Paris, Demea, 1838. The translation of the
Novum Organum is taken from Lasalle. The same translation
re-appears‚ with occasional corrections, and a few meagre notes, in
the less complete collection of the OEuvres de Bacon, Traduction
revue, corrigee, δια, by F. Riaux, a vols. Paris, 1843⁶².

⁸ M. Bouillet refers to a work entitled ‘Fragmens extraits des oeuvres dn chan·
cellier Bacon. traduits de l'edition anglaise de P. Shaw,' by Mary Dumoulin. Paris
and Amsterdam. 1765. but 1 have not been able to find this book ewen in the
Bibliotheque Nationale. It seems, amongst other things, to contain a good
analysis of the Novum Organum. See Bouillet‚ tome ii. Introd.‚ p. li'a

⁶⁷ Duringarecent visit to the Bibliotheque Nationalein ParisI foundan old French
translation in MS. of portioris of the Novum organum, contemporary, I believe, or
almost contemporary with the original publication of the work. It is written in a
beautiful band. very similar to much of the writing which 1 have seen in MSS.
of Bacon¹s own time, and not likely. M. Deprez, one of the gentlemen attached to

, the Manuscript Department‚ informed me. to be later thau the early part of the seven-

teenth century. This MS.. which is numbered Fr. 19992. formerly belonged to the
Coislin Collection and subsequently to the Library of St. Germain des Pres The
description of it in the catalogue is ss follows: ‘Ex Bibliotheca MSS. coisliniana,
