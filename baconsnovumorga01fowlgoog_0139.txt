116 INTRODUCYION.

Oldenburg, preserved by Antony Wood²⁸, says ‘he first fell in love
with the lord Bacon's philosophy in the year 1646: and who, in 1661,
published a work entitled ‘Britannia Baconica, or the Natural Rarities
of England‚ Scotland‚ and Wales, historically related, according to the
precepts of the Lord Bacon ;' together with many other writers whom
it would be tedious to enumerate.

The authorities cited are, however, amply sufficient to prove the
two points which 1 was anxious to establish: ret, that the foundation
of the Royal Society in England, and possibly also that of some
similar societies on the Continent, was due to the impulse given by
Bacon to the study of experimental science and the plans which he
devised for its prosecution; and, that some of the more eminent men
who were amongst the earliest members of that society, Wallis, Boyle,
Hooke, tec, were deeply imbued with the spirit of Bacon's teaching‚
and ready fully to recognise their obligations to him. If these facts
be established, as 1 think they are, there can be no question as to the
reality of Bacon's influence on the progress of science in the generation
immediately succeeding his own, whatever we may regard the nature
of that influence as having been ¹⁰.

Nor was the ‘New Philosophy' without its influence on the Uni-
versities‚ much as those bodies were occupied atthis time with other
questions, and deeply rooted as were their prejudices in favour of
the old learning. Even if we pass over the Letter of the University
of Oxfordfl, written on receipt of Bacon's De Augmentis in 162 3, in
which he is compared to a literary Hercules who has further advanced
the pillars of learning, deemed by others immovable, as savouring‚
perhaps too much of official flattery; and even if we reject, as testi-
mony to himself, and, therefore, perhaps, partial, what he says in his
letter to the King²⁸ about the reception of the Advancement of

¹¹ Published in Baconiana, pp. ²04-2t6. The letter is written, throughout, in
the most flattering strain, but. as Mr. Napier remarks, ¹ this piece of homage was
offered at a time when all motives to interested adulation had been done away by
Bacon's lamentable tart! The following is a specimen of the language of this
letter: ‘Creverunt quidem [musae] et sub calamo tuo, qui tanquam strenuus lite·
rarum Alcides, Columnas tuas, Mundo immobiles, propria manu in Orbe Scientl-
arum, plus altra statuisti. Euge exercitatissimum Athletam’ &c
