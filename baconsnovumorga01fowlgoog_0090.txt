vidual objects, may not admit ol being stated in such a iorm as to
occupy once more an important position in any scheme of Natural
Theology. Bearing in mind these qualifications, it may be perfectly
legitimate to speak, with reference to the universe at large, of design
and a designer, whatever may have been the agency, and however
mysterious and prolonged the process, by which an intelligent
Creator may have worked. Theories oi evolution may be so
stated as not to impair, but indefinitely to exalt, our ideas ol the
power, wisdom, and benevolence oi the Being in whom Nature
had its source ⁶⁵!

My conclusion, then, is, in briei, that Bacon did not intend to ex-
clude the employment ol the argument from Final Causes in Meta·
physics (or, as we should rather say, Natural Theology), while his
exclusion of it from the domain of physics was sar too rigid and
absolute. In his desence, however, it ought to be pleaded that the
use of this topic in ancient and mediaeval philosophy, as wellas in the
writings ol Bacon's contemporaries, was osten arbitrary, fancilul, arid
absurd to the last degree. ‘The handling of final causes' had cer·
tainly ‘intercepted the severe and diligent inquiry ol all real and
physical causes,’ and it might well be maintained that their temporary
expulsion, could it have been effected, would have been a real service
to science. As it was, 1 believe that the protest oi Bacon and
Descartes, who was as little tolerant as Bacon himself oi this mode oi
explaining physical phenomenatt, exerted a decidedly wholesome
influence on the scientific procedure oi their successore.

In my Inductive Logic, Ι have given a large number ol instances of
the absurd or misplaced employment of this Argument‚ which, I
think, will be quite sufficient to shew the pernicious and misleading

⁸⁸ ‘ lta deniqne nullas unquam rationes circa res naturales a fine, quem Deus aut
natura in iis faciendis sibi proposuit, desumemus; quia non tanturn nobis debemus
arrogare, ut ejus consiliorum participes nos esse putemus? De Principiis Philoso-
phiae, i. 28. In the Fourth Meditation, aiter speaking ol the difficulty ol pcne-
‘hating the divine designa, he continues: 'ex hoc satis etiam scio innumerabilia
illum posse quorum causas ignorem atque ob hanc unicam rationem totum illud
musarum genus quod a fine peti solet, in rebus Physicis nullum usum habere exis·
timo; non enim absque temeritate me puto posse investigare fines Det’ It would
not be difficult to maintain that Descarles' views‚ as expressed in these passages,
were influenced by those ol liacon.
