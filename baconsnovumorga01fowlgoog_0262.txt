been mixed up at first ln chaotic confusion. ln order to produce the

κόσμοι, they required to be separated and then re-combined in orderly
proportion. The agents in this process were respectively vrinae and φιλία.
See Metaph. i. 4.

³⁸ By tire Heraclitus understood not flante, but a kind of warm, dry
ether or refined alr, which he identified with soul and with the Diviue
Spirit. This tire was regarded as undergoing a constant process of evolu-
tlon (πάντα pei). By condensation it passes into the other and grosser
elements, and then these by rarefaction pass back again into it. Being
thus, as it were, the common element or basis, the ὕλη, so to speak, oi all
other existences, it may be regarded as itself ‘without distinctive pro·
perties,’ or ‘adiaphora’

²⁰ The student who has acquaiuted himself with the speculations of the
last three philosophers whom Bacon cites will hardly be disposed to accord
to them this praise. Their conceptions and theorles‚ when divested of the
metaphorical language in which they are clothed‚ are certainly of a meta-
physical rather than a physical character. Of Anaxagoras and Democritus
the same remark is also, to some extent, true.

³⁰ This phrase convicts Bacon of a literary error. The books entitled
Metaphysics (τὰ μετὰ τὰ φυσικά) were so called simply because of the place
assigned to them in the collected worlrs of Aristode, as next to the Physics.
The designatiou of these books has, however, been the origin of the terms
metaphysica Metaphysical, tite. Aristotle himself calls the science treated
of in the ‘Metaphysics’ σοφία, θεολογική, or πρώτη ἐπιστήμη.

¹¹ The question whether Aristotle was a reallst, a nominalist, or a

, conceptualist has been frequently debated. Confining ourselves to the ,

issue between the nominalists and realists‚ the general drift of his writings
and a majority of individual passages would favour the alternative that, had
the precise question between Nominalism and Realism been raised in his
time, he would have adopted the nominalist solution of the question as to
the nature of Universals. The most emphatic passage, perhaps, in support
of this view is that in the Categories, ch. 5 (p. a a. ιι &elz οὐσία δέ ἐστιν ἦ
