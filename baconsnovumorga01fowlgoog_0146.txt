INTRODUCTION. 123

and writings of Bacon? In the first place, I think that the reputation
of Bacon, as a reformet of scientific method, had now become so
established a fact, and the leading principles of his philosophy so well
known, that explicit reference to him was superfluous Those who
were constantly engaged in the pursuit of experimental philosophy
nonno more thought of referring to Bacon as an authority for the
general principles on which they proceeded‚ than those engaged
in the disputes of the schools thought of referring explicitly to the
works of Aristotle or their manuals of logie. And yet, in each case,
they would have been perfectly ready to acknowledge the extent of
their obligation, if any doubt had been cast upon it.

ln the second place, 1 must recall to the mind of the render what
I have already more than once bad occasion to mention, namely, the
comparative rarity of references to contemporary or recent writers
amongst the authors of the period of which 1 am treating. Thus,
we have seen that Locke, though, as l conceive and as is generally
supposed, owing the method and even the leading ideas of his
philosophy to Bacon, never mentions him by name or makes any
direct allusion to his writings. Galile0‚ as Ι have already remarked,
was, l believe, equally silent. But, then, Galileo makes no mention

of some of the most important discoveries of Kepler, even when it
lay in his way to do so ³⁸. Again, Kepler is never mentioned by
Descartes‚ and ‘in treating of the rainbow,' says Professor Playfair δ”,
‘Descartes has made no mention of Antonio de Dominis? I cannot

believe that, in all these cases, the silence is due to either contempt
or vanity or dishonesty, though, then as now, any of these motives
may in any particular case have been operative. 1 am rather inclined
to suppose that the authors of that time, writing for a learned class,
often did not think it necessary to mention books or discoveries which
were familiar to their readers, while we, writing for a more general
public, should be liable to be accused of ignorance or plagiarism‚ if we
were to observe a similar silence.

Lastly, Ncwton’s tastes and genius lay rather in the way of mathe-
matical science than of experimental philosophy, properly so called.
Bacon’s weakness, on the other hand, consisted in his deliciency of
mathematical knowledge, and his consequent incapacity of properly
estimating or criticising those branches of science which were already
