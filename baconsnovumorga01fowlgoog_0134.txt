INTRODUCTION. 111

oiBacon’s writings on the group of men who founded the Royal Society
or were amongst its earliest members, and the estimation in which he
was held bythem. This society, asiswell knowmoriginated in certain in-
sormal meetings during the CivilWars (according to Dr. Wallis in 664 5),
though it did not receive its Charter of Incorporation till 1662. Now
Bishop Sprat, its earliest historia'n, in a work written in 1667, speaks
ol Bacon, as having ‘had the true imagination oi the whole extent

os this enterprise, as it is now set on foot' And then he proceeds:
‘In whose books there are everywhere scattered the best argumente,
that can be produced for the delence of Experimental Philosophy 3
and the best directions that are neediul to promote it. All which
he has already adorned with so much art; that if my desires could
have prevailed with some excellent friends ol mine, who engaged me
to this work: there should have been no other Preface to the History
os the Royal Society, but some os his writings’ The passage is too
long to quote at length, but will be found in Dr. Sprat's History oi
the Royal Society, pp. 35, 36, and in Tenison’s Baconiana‚ pp. 264-
666. What Sprat, notwithstanding his eulogium of the philosophica}
works in general, says 66 the Sylva Sylvarum is unfortunately very
true: ‘He seems rather to take all that comes, than to choose; and
to heap rather than to register.’ ‘But' he adds, though ‘he had not
the strength 66 6 thousand men, I do allow him to have had as much
as twenty! .

In another place (p. 644), after complimenting Lord Clarendon
and the other Law Officers oi the Crown on their share in drawing
up the Cha'rter oi the Royal Society, Sprat goes on to say: ‘But
it is enough to declare that my Lord Bacon was a Lawyer, and that
these eminent officere of the Law have completed this foundation ol
the Royal Society: which was a work well becoming the largeness of
his wit to devise, and the greatness of their Prudence to establish!
The allusion here, 1 presume, is to the New Atlantis.

In Cowley's Ode to the Royal Society, Bacon’s name is equally
prominent: v

‘Some few exalted Spirits this latter Age has shown,
'Ihat labour'd to essert the Liberty
(From Guardians. who were now Usurpers grown)
06 this Old Minor still. ceptiv’d Philosophy:
But 'twas Rebellion call’d to fight
For such a long oppressed Right.
Bacon at lest, a mighty man, arose
Whom a wise King and Nature chose
Lord Chaucellour 66 6666 their Laws,
And boldly nndertook the injnr'd Pupil's cause!
