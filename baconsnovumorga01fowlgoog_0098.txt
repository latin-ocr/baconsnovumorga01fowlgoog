INT RODUC Τ ION. 75

the 'name' 01 Aristotle was associated with the ideas 01 inflexible
dogma and unreasoning opposition to enquiry. He was 101 them
the dictator, the tyrant 01 the schools‚ and, till he was dethroned,
there was no hope 101 any regeneration 01 science, or even 101 any
opportunity 01 sair discussion. Nor, considering the slavish delerence
which had long been paid to the name of Aristotle, can this feel·
. ing, however exaggerated and unreasoning the 101111 which it olten
assumed, be regarded with surprise. It seems to have originated
chiefly amongst the Italian ‘novellista’ as they are called by Baeon,
and to have spread rapidly amongst all who were loremost in the
revival either 01 science or letters. The works 01 Laurentius Valla,
Rodoiphus Agricola, H. C. Agrippa, Ludovicus vives, Paracelsus‚
Nizolius, Ramus‚ Telesius, Patricius, Giordano Brimo, Campanella, Ι
M. Aur. SeverinuS, Nicolaus Cabeus‘l, and others, all reem with
passages indicative 01 the reaction against Aristotelianism, and ex-
emplilying in various degrees the intensity 01 feeling, osten passing
into a bitterness approximating to personal hatred, with which the
attack on his authority was carried on. Of these 1 proceed to give
some instances, which are both interesting in themselves and illustrative
01 the spirit 01 violent hostility towards the old learning, and especially
towards the name 01 Aristotle, which is so frequently evinced in the
works 01 Bacon ⁷⁰.

Laurentius Valla (b. 1406, d. 1457), in the Prelace to his books
on Dialectic, claims the liberty 01 dissenting from Aristotle, adducing
the example 01 the older Greek philosophers who had always claimed
the liberty 01 dissenting even from the leader 01 their own sect:
‘Quo minus ferendi sunt recentes peripatetici, qui nullius sectae
homini interdicunt libertate ab Aristotele dissentiendi; quasi sophos
hic non philosophus, et quasi nemo hoc antea lecerit! lle then
quotes a number of Greek and Latin authors who had dissented srom
Aristotle, and proceeds: ‘At caeteri Latini caeteros philosophos pro
asophis habent: unum Aristotelem amplectentes. Quidni? cum
eum solum cognitum habeant: si modo cognoscere est, non in
propria sed in aliena lingua lectitare, ne dicam non sincera. Non
solum quia plerique ejus libri corrupte translati sunt, sed etiam quia
multa belle dicuntur graece, quae non belle dicuntur latine. Quae

‘⁸ Mueh more moderate iu their strictures were Cardan and Galileo, while
emongst the desenders 01 Aristotle we may count Pomponatius (b. 1461, d. 1514
016) and Caesalpinus (b. 1519, d. 1603).

¹⁸ The rarity 01 some' 01 these books must be my excuse 101 making extract‘s
rather than giving references. As su excuse 101 the length 01 some 01 the extracta
1 can only plead their interest.
