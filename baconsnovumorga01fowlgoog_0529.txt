bent, quae aut dirigunt operativam ad ea quae maxime
hominum intersunt; aut quae parcunt instrumentis; aut quae

parcunt materiae sive supellectili. Eas autem tres instantias

quae huc pertinent, uno nomine Instanrt'as Propitius sive Bena-
valas vocamus. Itaque de his septem instantiis jam sigillatim
dicemus3 atque cum iis partem illam de Praerogativis sive

Inter praerogativas instantiarum 'ponemus loco vicesimo
primo Instantius Virgae, sive Radii ⁹⁸,· quas etiam Instantrias

⁹⁸ Examples of these ‘instances' are not far to seek. We may notice the
thermometer‚ the barometer, the hygrorneter, the goniometer, the micro-
meter, the quadrant, scales, the photometer, the electrometer, the thermo·
electric pile, dre. Besides instruments, we may also include methods of
measurement‚ such as that ol double-weighiug or that of coincidences or
interferences. The student will find many good examples both of instru-
ments and methods amongst those given by Dr. Whewell in the Novum
Organum Renovatum‚ bk. iii. ch. a, or by Professor Jevons in the Prin-
ciples of Science‚ bk. iii. Some interesting remarks on the subject ot'
exact measurement, interspersed with illustrations, are made by Sir John
Herschel, Discourse, &c., ξς 11 5-a 5, 226-30, 387-9.

These instances, it must be remembered‚ ‘measure nature’ ‘per gradus
spatii’ as the ‘instantiae curriculi* ‘per momenta temporis! (See Aph. 4⁶
ad init.)

ln speaking of the defects ol Bacon's method, Professor Playfair says:
‘Another remark 1 must make on Bacon's methodis, that it does not give
sufficient importauce to the instantiae radii, or those which furnish us with
accurate measures of physical quantities. The experimeuts os this class
are introduced as only subservierit to practice; they are, however, ol
infinite value in the theoretical part of induction, or for ascertaining the
causes aud essences of the things inquired into. We hare an instance of
this in the discovery of that important truth in physical astronomy, that
the moon is retained in her orbit by the force of gravity, or the same
which, at the earth’s surface, makes a stone tall to the ground. This pno-
position, however it might have been suspected to be true, could never
have been demonstrated but by such observations and experiments as
assigned accurate geometrical measures to the quantities compared. The
semidiameter of the earth; the velocity of falling bodies at the earth’s
suriace; the distance of the moon, and her veloclty in her orbit 3—all these
four elements must have been determined with great precision, and after·
wards compared together by certain theorems deduced from the laws of
motion, before the relation between the force which retains the moon iu
