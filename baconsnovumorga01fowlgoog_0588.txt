moram3 nam idem fiet in lamina ferri (si augeatur mora),
quae non est expirabilis. Quod si non succedat experimentum
per moram simplicem, tamen non deserendum est negotium,
sed auxilia alia adhibenda. Non enim parum lucri fit, si
per violentias indi possint corporibus naturae fixae et conss
stantes. Hac enim ratione aer possit verti in aquam pe'r
condensationesli, et complura alia id genus. Dominus enim
est homo motuum violentorum, magis quam caeterorum.

(3) At tertius ex septem modis refertur ad magnum illud
organum, tam naturae quam artis, quoad operandum; videlicet
calidum et ¹frigidum. Atque in hac parte claudicat plane
potentia humana, tanquam ex uno pede. Habemus enim ca-
lorem ignis, qui caloribus solis (prout ad nos deferuntur) et
caloribus animalium quasi infinitis partibus potentior est et
intensior. At deest frigus ⁹⁷, nisi quale per tempestates
hyemales, aut per cavernas aut per circundationes nivis et
glaciei, haberi potest: quod in comparatione aequari potest
cum calore sortasse solis meridiano in regione aliqua ex
torridis, aucto insuper per reverberationes montium et pa-
rietum3 nam hujusmodi utique tam calores quam frigora

ab animalibus ad tempus exiguum tolerari'possunt. Nihili
autem sunt fere prae calore lomacis ardentis, aut alicujus

⁹⁶ This remark has, no doubt, reference to Bacon’s absurd theory of the
Transmutability of the Elements. See Aph. 48 (rr), with notes. But
there is a certain sense in which his anticipation bas been verified. For

' we now know that water might be produced, by means ol cold and

compression alone, from its constituent gases, hydrogen and oxygen.
ln lact, as already pointed out, all aeriform fluids are merely liquids
kept 'jn the state oi vapour by heat, and a sufficient amount of cold and
pressure will reduce them into the liquid state. See note 34 ou Aph. 33.

W Bacon, it need hardly be repeated, regarded cold as a distinct quality
from heat, not merely as a lower degree of it. The expression ‘variations
ol temperature,’ had it existed in his time, might, as 1 have already pointed
out, have preserved him from this error.

The greatest cold known is produced by the evaporation of liquefied
gases. By acceleratiug the evaporation ol a bath of carbonic anhydride
and ether, Faraday was enabled to obtain iu the vacuum of the air-pomp a
degree of cold which he estimated at - 166⁰ F. ‘Natterer obtained a still
more intense degree of cold than that produced by carbonic anhydride and
ether in vacuo, by mining liquid nitrous oxide with bisulphide of carbon,
and placing the bath in vacuo‚· the lowest temperature which he has
recorded is - 220⁰ F! See Miller's Elements of Cbemistry‚ part i.§ 196.
