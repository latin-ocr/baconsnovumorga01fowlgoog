post inventionem formarum, et processuum, et schematis-
morum, futuris temporibus apparebit. At ista effecta magica
(quantum adhuc . conjicimus) fiunt tribus modis: aut per
multiplicationem suiffl, ut in igne, et venenis, quae vocant
specifica ⁶⁷3 necnon in motibus, qui transeunt et fortificantur
de rota in rotam⁵⁸= aut per excitationem ⁵⁰ sive invitationem
in altero, ut in magnete, qui excit acus innumeras, virtute
nullatenus deperdita aut diminuta; aut in fermento, et hujus-
modi: aut per anteversionem motus⁶⁰, ut dictum est de pulvere
pyrio, et bombardis, et cuniculis: quorum priores duo modi
indagationem consensuum requirunt; tertius, mensurae mo·
tuum. Utrum vero sit aliquis modus mutandi corpora per
minima ⁶¹ (ut vocant), et transponendi ⁶² subtiliores materiae

⁸⁷ By a Specific Poison is properly meant a poison which is invariably
attended by the same group of sequelae, in opposition to a poison, the
effect oi which is different under different circumstances and on different
constitutions. Most specilic poisons, such as small-pon, measles, the
Morbus Gallicus, &c., possess the power oi seli-multiplicatiori, but this. is
not nn invariable property of such poisons. Thus, in lucifer-match manu-
factories, phosphorus produces necrosis oi the lower jau, and may, there-
fore, be regarded as a speciiic poison, but it does not act by way oi
seli-multiplication.

ln ii. 48 (12), Bacon refers the action of ‘some poisons’ to the ‘motus
excitationis!

⁶⁸ This is the principle oi the Wheel and Axle. But, as Mr. Kitchin
observes, the ‘fortificatio motus' takes place at the expense os speed.

⁸⁰ See liph. 48 (rs).

⁰⁰ See ii. 36 (7), 48 (ιο). The motion oi the nitre, from its abhorrente
oi fleme, is supposed to ‘anticipate' that oi the sulphur.

⁸¹ ln their smallest portioris, or atoms. Cp. the expression ‘latio per
minima' in i. 50. This is the second of the two modes of transformation,
spoken of attha beginning oi ii. 5.

⁶² We have already seen that the transformation oi bodies was a
cherished idea oi Bacon. See especially my Introduction, § 6, and the
Aphorisms at the beginning of this Book, with the notes. On the trans·
mutation of the metals‚ there are some very curious and interesting
remarks in the Historia Densi et Rari, E. and 8., vol. ii. pp. ago-r. There
he gives it as his opinion that other bodies cannot be turned into Gold, on
account oi its superior density, but that we may hope to effect the conver·
sion of lead or quicksilver into silver. Cp, on this subject, De Augmentis,
lib. iii. cap. 5 (E. and S, vol. i. p. 574). in the Sylva sylvarum, Exps.
326-8, he seems to be more hopeiui, and actually proposes a recipe ior the
making oi gold.

The last sentence oi the Aphorism is an attach on the Alchemists, who
