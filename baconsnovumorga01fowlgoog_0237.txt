Intellectus humanus ex proprietate sua ⁵⁷ facile supponit
majorem ordinem et aequalitatem in rebus, quam invenit:
etcum multa sint in natura monodica⁶⁸‚ et plena imparitatis,
tamen affingit parallela, et correspondentia, et relativa, quae
non sunt ⁵⁹. Hinc commenta illa, in coelestibus omnia moveri
per circulos perfectos, lineis spiralibus et draconibusll (nisi

⁸⁷ ‘Owing to its peculiar nature! Cp. ‘propter naturam propriam’ at
the beginning of Aph. 5¹·

⁸³ That is, monadica. Mr. Ellis observes that, throughout his writings,
Bacon has fallen into this error.

⁰⁹ This excessive love of system, or tendency to feign parallels and
similitudes where none exist, is, in a logical classification of the fallacia,
best referred to F alse Analogy. See Mr. Mill's Logic, bk. v. ch. 5. § ⁶, and
my inductire Logic, 3rd ed. pp. 3²4-336· The fanciful application of
numbers has always played a great partin fallacious conceptions of this
character. See a curious article on the number Seven in the Classical
Journal, vol. viii. One of the latest instances of scientific researches being
influenced by these speculations is afforded in the case of Huyghens. ‘The
attention which Huyghens,’ says Professor Playfair (PreliminaryDissertation
to the Encyclopedia Britannica), ‘had paid to the ring of Saturn, led him
to the discovery of a satellite of the same planet. His telescopes were not
powerful enough to discover more of them than one; be believed, indeed,
that there vvere no more, and that the number of the planets now dis·
covered was complete. The reasoning by which he convinced himself, is
a proof how slowly men are cured of their prejudices, even with the best
talents and the best information. The planets, primary and secondary‚
thus made up twelve‚ the double of six, the first of the perfect numbers.
ln 1⁶71, however, Casslni discovered another satellite, and afterwards
three more, making five in all, which the more perfect telescopes of
Dr. Herschell have lately augmented to seven?

lt must be remembered, however, that some of the greatest discoveries
in science have originatcd in the bold use of Analogy. Τ hus, the whole
science of Biology has been revolutionised by following out the analogies
between vegetable and animal life, between fossil remains and living
organisms‚ between the structure, habits, and faculties of the lower ani-
mals and those of men. The extension of the idea of ware-motion to
explain the phenomena of light and sound‚ and the strilring and startling

. analogies which have often given the first clue to ascertaining the

altiryiities of languages‚ are other instances which will occur to almost every
rea er. ·’

⁰⁰ The best commentary on this passage is to be found in the Thema
Coeli (E. and S, vol. iii. pp. 774·5)· ‘At manifestum est, planetas
non solum impari gradu contendere, sed nec ad idern punctum circuli
reverti, verum deflectere versus austrum et boream, cujus deflexionis
