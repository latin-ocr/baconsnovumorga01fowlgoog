Jarn vero proponendum est exemplum exclusionis sive
rnectioms naturarum, quae per tabellas competentiae repe·
riuntur non esse ex forma calidi; illud interim monendo, non
solum sufficere singulas tabulas ad rejectionem alicujus naturae,

express the phenomenon. But its efficient causes, the agencies which pro-
duce it, may be, and are, several, as, for instance, friction‚ chemical com·
bination‚ electricity, dcc. Hence, where by ‘form' Bacon means, as l
think he usually does, ‘nature’ there is only one form, and to the ques·
tion, for example, What is beat? there is, and only can be, one answer.
But, where by ‘forrn' he means ‘law’ or ‘cause,' there may be many
forms; thus there are, for example, in this sense, as many forms of heat as
there are distinct modes of its productiori. At the same time, we must re-
member that if the word ‘form’ with Bacon is vague and obscure, the word
‘law’ is so also, and we are not always justified in assuming that the latter
word is employed by him in the same sense in which it is usually employed
by us. The ‘ law' oi an obiect or quality may be what we sometimes call
the ‘law of its being,’ and thus not differ really from its ‘nature’ To add,
therefore, to our perplexity with reference to Bacon's employment of the
word ‘form,' we can seldom be quite certain ln which of its two senses,
nature or essence, and law or cause, he is using it; and, in fact, sometimes
he seems to be using it ln both at once. For a further discussion of this
subject, see Introduction, ς 8. The objections founded on the considera·
tion of the Plurality of Causes would, of course, not apply to ‘Form’
employed as=Nature. But it need hardly be remarhed that a philosophy
which confined itself to investigating the ‘natures' or ‘essences' of things,
without taking any account of their causes or the laws which determine
their productim, would be exceedingly desectIve on the side of both know·
ledge and practice.
