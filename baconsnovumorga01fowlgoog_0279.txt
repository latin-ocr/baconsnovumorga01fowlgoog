LXXI.⁸⁰

Scientiae, quas habemus, fere a Graecis fluxerunt. Quae
enim scriptores Romani, aut Arabes ⁸¹, aut recentiores addi·
derunt, non multa aut magni momenti sunt: et qualiacunque
sint, fundata sunt super basin eorum quae inventa sunt a
Graecis. Erat autem sapientia Graecorum professoria, et in
disputationes effusam: quod genus inquisitioni veritatis
adversissimum est. Itaque nomen illud sophistarum⁸³, quod
per contemptum ab iis, qui se philosophos haberi voluerunt,

⁸⁰ Here begin the live signs of the weakness and insufficiency of the
preceding philosophies. The first sign which is taken from their origin
amongst the Greeks, is discussed under two heads: (α) ‘ex ortu et gente
philosophiae,' treated in Aph. 713 (β) ‘ex natura temporis et aetatis,'
' treated iu Aph. 7²·
⁸¹ lt is almost needless to gbserve that this censure is too severe. The
' Romans might, at least, have been credited with the mechanieal skill ¹
which enabled them to construet such magnificent roads, aqueducts, .
bridges, amphitheatres, ‚deq and the Arabians (even if Bacon despised the
share they had in reviving the study of the Aristotelian philosophy in Europe)
with their part in the invention of our present numerals and of the science
of Algebra, with the discovery of distillation, with their contributione to the
science of medicine, with the first essays at a science of chemistry‚ dcc.
ln the desire to lay the foundations of a new method and a new body of
science‚ there can be no question that Bacon was disposed to undervalue
what had already been achieved. Towards the ‘recentiores’ he assumes a
fairer tone in Aph. 109.

⁸¹ ln this tendency to questioning and disputation‚ however, originated
philosophy and abstract speculation. The Hindoos and Greeks alone, in
the ancient world, appear to have possessed such a tendency in any marked
degree. Without it, poetry, practical inventione, and maxims of conduct are
possible, but not philosophy, or, to any great extent, even scientific theory.

Β The following sentences are remarkable, as containing a view of the
Sophists which has now been rendered familiar to English readers by the
works of Mr. Lewes and lllr. Grote. ln pointing out the original appli-
cation of the term ‘Sophists’ to all philosophers indifferently, in glancing
at the connection between the Sophists properly so called and the Rhetors,
and in specifying the wandering life and the taking of fees as the charaeter-
istics mainly distinguishing the Sophists so·called from the philosophers
so·called, Bacon undoubtedly anticipates some of the principa! points for
which hir. Grote contends.
