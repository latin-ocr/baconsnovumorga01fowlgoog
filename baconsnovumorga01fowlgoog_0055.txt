recommended by any other important considerations than those of its
simplicity. This important discovery, which was announced to the
world in the Sydereus Nuncius in 1610, irresistibly suggested an
analogy between the small system of Jupiter, now ocularly demon·
strated, and the large system of the Sun, as depicted theoretically by
the followers of Copernicustt From this point the controversy
assumed anew phase, as is evidenced, amongst other things, hy the
increased warmth of the dispute.. 'Evcn still, however, and notwith-
standing the matbematical precision given to the theory by the
investigatione of Kepler (whose worlr De Motibus Stellae Martis
was published in 1609), it cannot be said that, till the laws of formal '
astronomy were connected by Newton with the physieal laws of matter
and motion, the motions of the earth or its relation to the rest of the
solar system could in any way be regarded as placed beyond the
range of dispute. ln Bacon's time, and especially during the earlier
period of his life, men might be well excused who suspended their ,
judgment, or who even preferred to adhere to the old assumption till
their obJections to the new theory were removed. The following
sentences from Mr. De Morgan⁷⁰ are so apposite, and read a lesson
so universally uieful to uS, in estimating the scientific judgments of
men in past ages, that Ι arn sure my readers will be grateful to
me for transcribing them. ‘By investing Copernicus with a system
which requires Galileo, Kepler, and Newton to explain it, and their
pupils to understand it, the modern astronomer refers the want of
immediate acceptance of that system to ignorance, prejudice, and
over adherence to antiquity. No doubt all these things can be traced;
but the ignorance was of a lrind which belonged equally to tbe
partisans and to the opponents, and which fairly imposed on the pro·
pounder of the system the onus of meeting arguments, which, in the
period we spealr of, he did not and could not meet. It must be
remembered that, in the sixteenth century, the wit of man could not
imagine how, if the carth moved, a stone thrown directly upwards
would tumble down upon the spot it was thrown from. Easy er·
periments verify the law of motion which now explains this ; but to
be proved by experimenta law must be conceived and imagined.
To be put under discussion, it must be proposed. Now the advocates

⁷⁵ Even Bacon was sufficiently moved by this discovery to include among his
affinnatlons in the Thema Coeli (E. and S, vol. iii. p. 780), ‘solisequium ex natura
inopiosa in ignibus infirmioribus Veneris et Mercurii ς cum etlam inventae sinte
Galilaea stellulae errantes Jovis asseclae.¹
