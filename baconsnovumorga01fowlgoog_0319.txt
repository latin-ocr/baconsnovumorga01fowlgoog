simile etiam de nobis judicium futuris temporibus factum iri

⁷⁰ This, the sintii, is one of the most important of the ‘Grounds of
Hope.’ Itis taken from the future construction of a Natural History,
specially adapted to the wants of Natural Philosophy (‘ collecta ad in·
formandum intellectum in ordine ad condendam philosophiam ⁹), and
containIng a record of experiments as well as observations. This ‘Natural
History' was tu be supplied ln the third part of the Instauratio Magna,
which was to be entitled ‘Phaenomena Universi, sive Historia Naturalis
et Experimentalis ad condendam Philosophiam) Towards constructing
this third part of the Instauratio several attempts were made by Bacou,
asin the Historia Ventorum, HistorIa Vitae et Mortis, Historia Densi
et Rari, Sylva Sylvarum, dcc. These works are collected in the third
volume of Ellis and Speddmg’s Edition, pp. 1-680. lt must be confessed‚
however, of these pieces, that they answer but very imperfectly to Bacon's
conception ofa natural history as delineated in this Aphorism. Far the
most successful, perhaps the only successful, part of Liebig's attach on
Bacon is directed against this class of his writings.

On the supreme lmportance which Bacon attached to the collection of
observations and experiments thch it was his intention to maire, see
Mr. Spedding’s Preface to the Parasceue, given in vol. i. of the Collected
Worhs, pp. 369-390. I cannot, however, but think that Mr.Spedding
slightly exaggerates the importanee which Bacon attached to this part of
his reform. Surely ‘the novelty, from thch the most irnportant results
were to be expected,’ if we are to select any one part of the scheme as
such, was his Inductive Method. ‘Spes est una ln inductione vera.’ ‘In
hac certe inductione' (namely, induction as reformed by himself) ‘spes
maxima sita est! .

lt may be remarked, however, as a proof of the great importanee which
Bacun attached to his Natural History, that, when he publisbed the Novum
Organum in its fragmentary form, passing over all the ‘auxilia intellectus'
(see lib. ii. Aph. αι) between the first and eiglith, he thought it desirable
to append an account of the latter, as fumishing a description of the plan
on which his Natural History was to be constructed. The title of this
Appendix is ‘Parasceue ad Historiam Naturalem et Experimentaleni,' οι·
