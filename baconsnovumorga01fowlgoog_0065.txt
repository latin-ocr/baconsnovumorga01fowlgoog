wonderful appreciation ol the combined unity and variety in Natrlre, Ι
as well as of the necessity of never losing sight of the one in con·
sidering the other. See, for example, Nov. Org. ii. 17, and the
Instantiae clandestinae, Monadicae, Deviantes‚ and Foederis to which
M. Bouillet so appropriately calls attention (he might have added the
Instantiae Confonnes and Limitaneae) in his note on that passage.

Bacon's constant references to the new science of Magnetism,
recently almost created by Gilbert‚ shew no unwillingness to accept
novel theories, when they did not, as seemed to him to be the
case with the Copemican theory, involve complex and arbitrary
assumptions.

The suggestions and contributione made by Bacon to the sciences
of mind and conduct seem tome neither few nor nnimportant. But
to these I have drawn attention in two other sections, that on his
general philosophical opinions and that on his influence on Philosophy
and Science.

lhave reserved to the last some remarks on the investigation into
the nature of Heat, which occupies so conspicuous a place in the
, Novum Organum. Itis quite true, as Mr. Ellis points ont in his
General Preface ¹³, that the provisional conclusion adopted by Bacon
inii. ao, as his Vindemiatio Prima, is not the result of the Method of
Exclusion, but rests immediately upon the three tables of Comparentia.
Hence it does not pretend to be the result of formal prooi, but only a
sort of probable hypothesis based upon the consideration and com-
parison oi a large number of instances. Separating, however, the
question of the mode by which it was arrived at from the nature and
valne of the conclusion itself‚ I think Bacon must be credited with
having in a remarkable manner anticipated one of the most beautiful
and important discoveries of modern science. Stripping it of certain
excrescenceS, the essential part of the conclusion is that Heat is an
expansive motion amongst the minute partiales of bodies. And this,
after much speculation and experimentation, and the predominance,
for a long time, of another theory, namely, that beatis a subtle fluid,
called Caloric‚ is the precise conclusion at which the most eminent
physicists have at length arrived. Professor Tyndall does Bacon the
justice of quoting in an Appendix ¹⁴ a considerable portion of the

¹³ Vol. i. pp. 36, 37.

¹⁴ See the Appendix to ch. 2 of Tyndall's Heat a Mode of Motion. It is only
fair, perhaps, that 1 should referto the unfavourable opinion of this example ex-
pressed by Dr. Whewell (Philosophy of Discovery, chs. 15, 16), who prononnces
that ‘as an example of the mode of interrogating Nature, it canum be looked upon
