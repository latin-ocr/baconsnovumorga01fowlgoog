Bouillet refers to an Essay on the Philosophy ol Bacon by Uln'ch
Berlin, 1780.

In the Encyclopedie Methodique, Philosophie Ancienne et Modeme‚
there is along article on ‘Baconisme,' signed by M. Naigeon, giving
a classified account of Bacon's opinions on various topics. This
article, in which the author follows the estimate of Bacon taken by the
EncyclopedistS, appeared in 1791. It incorporates most of Deleyre's
Analysis

Le Sage, in along letter in the Bibliotheque Britannique, Sciences
et Ans, tome ix, Genava, 1798, brings together anumber os quotations
from Bacon, sor the purpose of shewing that he did not reject the
enquiry into the general causes of phenomena. In tome viii. ol the
same series, there is a letter by Le Sage, not expressly written on
Bacon, but occasionally alluding to or quoting him. Neither of these
articles, however, seems to correspond with the one referred to by
Remusat (p. 392), as contained in tome viii.

by J. A. De Luc, and are directed against Lasalle, who had written
with a strong pre-disposition to find in Bacon the philosophical and
theological principles oi the Revolntion. De Luc refers to the Abbe
Emery's worlr, Le Christianisme, &c lt may be noticed that Lasalle
had omitted all those passages in Bacon’s works which appeared to
have a religious tendency‚ calling them contemptuously ‘les oremus?
