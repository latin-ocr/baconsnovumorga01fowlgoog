'greatest candour, ‘quae etiam viros graves ita obstupefecit, ut mallent
credere motum terrae ⁸²3 Again, in ii. 48 (ιγ), speaking also oi the
motion oi the heavens, he says: ‘Attamen gravis de illo motulis est
iuter nonnullos tam ex antiquis quam modernis, qui rotationem terrae
attribuerunt! In the De hugmentiS, iv. 1 (E. and S., vol. i. p. 580),
we have a cautious and discriminating statement, which must have
commended itsell to many men at the time: ‘Constat similiter sen-
tentiam Copemiei de Rotatioue Terrae (quae nunc quoque invaluit),
quia phoenomenis non repugnat, ab Astronomicis Principiis non posse
revinci ; a Naturalis tamen Philosophiae Principiis, recte positis, posse!
In the Thema Coeli, though he sums up his opinion at the end,
by sayiug ‘Negant terram rotare,' he speaks, in the body ol the work
asli at one time be had actually hesitated between the two theories:
‘Terra itaque stante (id enim nunc nobis videturverius)⁸³.’ This work,
however, was written about 1612. In the De Augmentis, published in
162 3,he prouounces himself lar more positively: ‘harum suppositionum'
(se. oi the Ptolemaic System) ‘absurditas in motum terrae diurnum
(quod nobis constat falsissimum esse) homines impegit ⁸⁹! Even this
statement, however, emphaticas it is, is sar srom exhibiting ‘the most
'positive disdain.' Lastly, I ought to mention that, in the Descriptio
Globi Intellectualis⁰⁰, Bacon actually advances some very cogent
reasons against the Copemican theory, as it was then stated, reasons
indeed so cogent that they are amongst those which have led to
considerable modifications ol that theory ⁸¹.

1 conceive, then, with regard to this point, that, on the whole, 1 have
made out a case, ii not for aequittal, at least lor very considerable miti-
gation of judgment. Bacon appears, in early lile, like the majority, pro
bably, oi even his scientific contemporaries, to have conceived a strong
preJudiee against the Copemican theory. In middle lile, he seems
lor a timeto have wavered, or, at least, to have felt some hesitation,
though never, Ι believe, to the extent oi adopting the theory oi tbc

⁸² lu tbe next paragraph, speaking of Galileo's theory oi the tides, he adds: 'Sed
boc commentus est concesso non concessibili (quod terra nempe moveatur).'

'¹ One ol these, the triple motion os the carthus conceived byCoperuicus, seems
to have been amongst the reasons which presented Gilbert lrom positively adoptiug
the theory oi the orbitnl motion, though he was an enthusiastic adherent ol the
theory ol the diurnal motion. See his posthumous work, referred to above, lib. ii.
