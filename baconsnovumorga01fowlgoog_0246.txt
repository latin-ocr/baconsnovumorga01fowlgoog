latet, et homines fugit. Omnis etiam subtilior meta-sche-
matismus⁸³ in partibus rerum crassiorum (quern vulgo altera-
tionem vocant, cum sit revera latio per minima ⁸⁴) latet
similiter: et tamen nisi duo ista, quae diximus, explorata
fuerint et in lucem producta, nihil magni fieri potest in
natura quoad opera. Rursus ipsa natura a'e'ris communis et
corporum omnium, quae ae'rem tenuitate superant (quae
plurima sunt), fere incognita est. Sensus enim per s'c res
infinna est, et aberrans: neque organa ad amplificandos

sensus aut acuendos multum valent; sed omnis verior inter· ,

pretatio naturae conficitur per instantias, et experimenta

Intellectus humanus fertur ad abstracta propter naturam
propriam3 atque ea, quae fluxa sunt, fingit esse constantia.
Melius autem est naturam secare, quam abstrahere ⁸⁶ ; id quod
Democriti schola fecit, quae magis penetravit in naturam,

ε’ Bacon appears to hare adopted a theory of the ultimate constitution
of matter, in some respects similar to that of the lltomists (see especially
Bk. 11. Aph. 8); and hence his partiality for the school of Democritus.
He rejected, however, the hypothesis of a vacuum, and it does not appear
whether his atoms (or rather particles, as he preferred to call them)
differed in material or only in shape and arrangement. Any way, all mate-
rial objects, he conceived, if only we could penetrate to their ultimate
structure or constitution, would be found to consist of a number of small
particles, arranged in some definite manner with reference to each other.
.· This arrangement, as it escapes detection, is called Larem Schemarr'smas,
'⁴ and any change iu it is termed Meta-Schemarismus,· moreorer, as the
¹ hrtemal process by which such change takes place is unknown to us, it
is called Larem Processus. (See Bk. ii. Aphs ⁶, 7.)

⁸⁴ lt follows from Bacon's theory of the ultimate constitution of matter
that any alteration (ἀλλοίωσις) in a body is simply a motion amongst the
minute particles, a change in their arrangement, ‘latio per minima!

⁸⁵ lt is better to dissect nature by means of analysis, than to form
abstract theories about her, which have no foundation in fact or erpe-
riment. The work of ‘abstraction,' that is of forming abstract or general
theories, is, of course, indispensable in the interpretation of nature, but it
ought to follow and not precede the work of ‘dissection,' that is, the
minute examinatiou and interrogation oi natural facts. lt ison account
of their patience or supposed patience in the investigation of nature that
the school of Leucippus and Democritus seems to have been preferred by
bacon to the other schools of antiquity.
