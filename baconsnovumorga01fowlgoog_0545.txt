Inter praerogativas instantiarum ponemus loco vicesimo
quarto instantias Laetae ,· quas etiam Instantius Praedomi·
nantiae appellare consuevimus ⁴⁷. Eae indicant praedomi-

nantiam et cessionem virtutum ad invicem; et quae ex iltis
sit fortior et vincat, quae infirmior et succumbat. Sunt enim
motus et nixus corporum compositi, decompositi‚ et complicati,
non minus quam corpora ipsa. Proponemus igitur prImum
species praecipuas motuum sive virtutum activamm; ut
magis perspicua sit ipsarum comparatio in robore, et exinde
demonstratio atque designatio instantiarum luctae et prae·
dominantiae.

aphorism.

⁴⁸ The necessity of bearing in mInd Baeon’s caution is well illustrated in
the ease ol the expansion of water, as well as ol bismuth and the eastlng·
metals generally, which are, at certam temperaturas, an exceptIon to the
general law that bodies expand with every increase in temperature. ln
acase like this, mere analogy might easily deeere us. See my Inductlre
Logic, 3rd Ed„ pp. 137-8.

⁴⁷ ‘By an oversight,’ as ΜΓ. Kitchin remarks, ‘Bacon gives the same
second name to these Instances as he does to the third class (hph. 24),
namely, “instantiae ostensirae ι r ι quas etiam elucescentias, sive instan-
tias liberatas et praedominantes, appellare consuevaus.''’ By comparing
the two sets oi instanceS, it will be seen, however, that the word is used ln
totally different senses.

These ‘InstantIae Luctae’ or ‘wreslllng instances’ (as they are best
called) comprise what Bacon conceived to be the various conflictmg liads
of motion. The discussion, as well as his use of the term ‘ Motion,' will
often be found to be vague and unsatisfactory. The indestructibility ol
matter (‘ motus antitypiae materiae ⁹) and even the property of inertia
itseli (‘ motus decubItus, sive motus exhorrentiae motus ⁹) are included
by hlm under this generic name. Motion, 1 need hardly say, ought,
strictly speaking, to be used in the sense oi ‘change of plaee‚’ though
it may legitimately be applied to changes in the relative positious of the
