’ hlagnete,' published in 1600, there is much which admits of com·

parison with some of Bacon's Aphorisms. Thus, he contrasts
experiments and demonstrations with probable conjectures and ‘vulgo
philosophantium placita? After describing, with much disparage·
ment, the ‘tam vastus Librorum Oceanus, quibus studiosorum
ingenia perturbantur fatiganturque,’ he asks: ‘Quid ego huic tam
perturbatae reipublicae literariae aliquid ulterius adjungerem, aut
juratis in aliorum sententias, aut absurdissimis bonarum artium cor·
raptoribus, literatis idiotis, grammaticis sophistis, rabulis, et plebeculae
perversae, Philosophiam banc inclytam, et propter inaudita plurima
quasi novam, et incredibilem damnandam et maledictis dilacerandam
exponerem? Sed vobis tantum fere philosophantibus viris ingenuis,
qui non err libris solum, sed ex rebus ipsis scientiam quaeritis,
fundamenta ista magnetica commendavi, novo philosophandi genere.
At si ipsis opinionibus et paradoxis assentire aliquibus visum non
luerit, videant tamen experimentorum et inventorum, quibus praecipue
floret philosophia omnis, magnam frequentiam: quae multis nostris
curis, vigiliis, et impensis eruta et demonstrata sunt. Illis gaudete,
et in meliores usus, si poteritis, fruimini. Scio, quemadmodum
arduum est vetustis novitatem dare, obsoletis nitorem, obscuris lucem,
fastiditis gratiam, dubiis fidem: ita multo magis novis et inauditis,
contra omnes omnium opiniones, authoritatem aliquam conciliare et
stabilire, difficillimum. Neque illud curamus 3 paucis enim philo-
sophandum censuimus! The ancient Greelcs he forbears to call
to his aid. To Aristotle, Ptolemy, Galen, &c., ‘suus semper honos
tribuatur.' But our age also has brought to light many things which,
had they been alive, they would freely have embraced. He uses the
expression ‘libere philosophari,’ and, throughout, extols experiment.
lt is needless to add that the body ol Gilbert’s work lurnishes many
examples ol bold, ingenious, and apposite experimenta

When we pass in review these and similar writers, we see that the
origin of knowledge in the perceptions of the senses, as taught by Aris-
totle, had been a tradition of the schools, which had been constandy
repeated with more or less ol emphasis and more or less conscious·
ness ol its significance; that its corollary, the necessity, sor the
purposes os sciense, ol careful observation ol laets, had, though more
fitsully, still repeatedly been asserted, and, amongst Bacon's immediate
predecessors and contemporaries, bad become almost a common-place
ol the more liberal and adventurous investigators of nature. Experi-
ment, too, though more rarely, had been warmly recommended in
