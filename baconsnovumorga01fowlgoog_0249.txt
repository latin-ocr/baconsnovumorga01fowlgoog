experimentis fornacis, philosophiam constituerunt phantas-

ponere, nosque verbis addicere! Bacon, however, is not always consistent
in his abuse of Aristotle. Sometimes he speaks of him in terms of eulogy,
as. for instance, in Aph. 98 and in the following passage of the Redargutio
Philosophiarum: ‘ltaque bos duos viros, Platonem et Aristotelem, si quis
inter maxima mortalium ingenia non numerat aut minus perspicit aut
minus aequus est?

The specific charge against Aristotle that he subordinated his natural
philosophy to bis logie is undoubtedly founded in part on his partiality for
the technical forms and terminology of the syllogism. This circumstance
often obscures his argument (as we may see even in the oth and yth Boolrs
of the Ethics), and also often has a tendency to divert his attention l'rom
the arbitrary or questionable character of the principles on which his
reasoning proceeds. But under the phrase ‘¹ logicae suae,’ Bacon probably
includes not only ‘ logic' properly so called, but also the metaphysical dis-
tinctions which are of such frequent occurrence in Aristotle's works.
Instead of explaining physical phenomena in their true relations or by
reference to their true causes, Aristotle frequently, if not generally, deems
it sufficient to bring them under bis metaphysical distinctions of δύναμις and
ἐνέργεια, matter, form, and privation, the four causes, the ten categorias,
the different kinds of motion, and the like. Of. this tendency we have
a notable instance in the De Coelo, where we should naturally expect to
lind a careful account of observed facts with reference to the earth and the
heavenly bodies; instead of this account, however, we have interminable
discussions on substance, qualities, the various kinds of motion, and other
topics ofa like rnetaphysical character. The title of tbis treatise, bow·
ever, was not given by Aristotle himself.

⁹¹ Bacon frequently refers to the ‘Chemists' or ‘Alcbemists‚’ and gene·
rally in the same terms. See Aphs. ⁶4 and73. They are criticised at
length, both on their practica} and speculative side, in the Redargutio
Philosophiarum (E. and 8., iii. 575, 576). There is also an interesting
notice of them in the De llugrnentls, lib. l. (vol. i. p.457).

ln the word ‘phantasticam' he probably has specially in view the specu·
lationsof Paracelsus and his school; in the expression ‘ad pauca spectantem'
the narrow range of objects, such as the transformatiou of metals and the
discovery of the elixir vitae, to which the Chemists or Alchemists of that
time confined their attention.

Professor Playfair, in a passage already referred to, says (Encycl.
Brit, Prel. Diss.): ‘Chemistry in this state might be said to have an

Elective Attraction for all that was most absurd and extravagant in the
other parts of knowledge!
