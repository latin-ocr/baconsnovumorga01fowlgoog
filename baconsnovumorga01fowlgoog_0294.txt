ΠΒ. I. 81. 271

Itaque minime mirum est si scientiae non crescant, cum a
radicibus suis sint separatae.

LXXXI.

Rursus se ostendit alia causa potens et magna, cur scientiae
parum promoverint. Ea vero haec est ; quod fieri non possit,
ut recte procedatur in curriculo, ubi ipsa meta non recte posita
sit et defixa. Meta autem scientiarum vera et legitima non
alia est quam ut dotetur vita humana novis inventis et copiis²⁴.

with which the more special sciences should be brought into connection,
and which should deal with the laws of nature and man in amore corn·
prehensive manner than it was possible for the more special sciences to do.
i lt was to give, as it were, a general surrey of nature, and then the more
i special sciences were to follow out in detail particular departments,
never, however, losing sight of the common stoclr with which they were
connected.

The inclusion of ‘affectus et prehensiones intellectuales’ among the
objects of Natural Philosophy, though inconsistent with Bacon’s employ-
ment of the word in the De Augmentis, is in accordanee with ancient
usage. The word Psychology is comparatively modern, and the questions
of which that science treats were included by ancient authors under
Physiology or Physics. Thus, the De Anima was always ranhed among
the physical works of Aristotle. lu the old Statutes of the University
of Oxford, among the books on which the ‘Praelector Naturalis Philo-
sophiae ’ was to lecture were the ‘libri de Anima' For instances of the
Aristotelian use of the words ‘physical’ and ‘physiological,' as including
what we should call ‘psychological‚' see Eth. rii. 3 (9, ra).

aliam esse, quam ut genus humanum novis operibus et potestatibus con-
tinuo dotetur!

This, as l have pointed out in the Introduction (p. ¹²7 and elsewhere), is
oue of the watchwords of the Baconian philosophy. But we must, at least,
take it in conjunction with the maxim which Bacon is never weary of
repeating: ‘Lucifera experimenta, non fructifera quaerenda! lt often
happens that enquiries which at first sight appear to have no practical
bearing are ultimately found to contribute largely to the comforts and
conveniences of life. But, even if this were not the case, it might be
maintained, and maintained rightly, that knowledge should be sought for
its own sake. No reason can be given why man should not be at full
liberty to gratify his desire of knowledge, his curiosity to know all that is
about aud within him, as much as any other desire of his nature. As
Bacon himself says in the Praise of Knowledge, ‘Are not the pleasures
of the allections greater than the pleasures of the sensesi And are not
the pleasures of the intellect greater than the pleasures of the affectione?
ls not knowledge a true and only natural pleasure, whereof there is no
satietyi’
