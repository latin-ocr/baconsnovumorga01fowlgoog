causa crepusculi, inter alias, est reflexio⁴ radiorum solis a
superiore parte a'e'ris. Etiam quandoque reflecti videmus
radios solis temporibus vespertinis serenis a fimbriis nubium

' roscidamm, non minori splendore, sed potius illustriori et ,
magis glorioso, quarn qui redditur a corpore lunae⁶; neque Ἴ

. tamen constat eas nubes coaluisse in corpus densum aquae.
Etiam videmus aerem tenebrosum pone fenestras noctu re-
ilectere lucem candelae, non minus quarn corpus densum⁶.
Tentandum etiam soret experimentum immissionis radiorum
solis perforamen super flammam aliquam subfuscam et cae-
ruleam. Sane radii aperti soliS, incidentes in flammas obscu-
riores, videntur eas quasi mortificare, ut conspiciantur magis
instar lumi albi quam flammae. Atque haec impraesentiarum
occurrunt, quae sint ex natura instmiiarum crusti ciroe hanc
rem⁷; et meliora sortasse reperiri possunt Sed notandum
semper est, reflexionem a flamma non esse expectandam, nisi ,

⁴ Retraction, as wellas Reflexion, enters into the explanation of this aud
similar phenomena.

⁶ Mr. Ellis remarks that the comparisou of the brightness oi the moon
in the daytime with that of a cloud was ingeniously applied by Bouguer to
detennine the ratio of the moon’s light to the sun's.

“Bacon's reason for this phenomenon is wrong. lt is really the
polished sudare of the glass which relleets the rays: and thls is always
the case, but is only visible to us when there is neither light nor object
on the other side to destroy the image created? Mr. Kltchin’s note.

⁷ All that these instances prove is that other than solid bodies retteet
light, and hence it follows that, because the moon reflecte light, we cannot
inser that it is a solid body. But, though they dispose of the argument,
they do not dispose of the conclusion. How little Bacon anticipated that
the time would come, when we should be able to weigh the moon, to
know something of its chemical constituente, and to map out its suriace
with perfect accuracy!

The question whether other than solid bodies reflect light ls a good
example of an untiareral test (see the end of the lirst note on this aphor-
ism). li decided one way, it proves that the moon is a solid body3 ir
decided the other way, it proves nothing.

⁸ Cp. Aph. ²3· There, he says, ‘corpora omnino aequalia (secundum ἒ

portiones optieas) dare diaphanum.’ The optical generallsation that every ,
ray of light incident on a surface is either reflected, or transmitted, or ³
