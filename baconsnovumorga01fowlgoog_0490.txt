per lineas spirales3 adeo ut inaequalitas restitutionis et
declinatio ad tropicos possint esse potius modificationes motus
unici illius diurni, quam motus renitentes aut circa diversos
polos. Et certissimum est, si paulisper pro plebeiis nos gera-

illud in more est ut sensui in multis immerito vim faciant,

⁹⁰ ‘On his assertion,' says Dr.Whewell (in the passage referred to above),
‘that the motion of each separate planet is, to sense, a spiral, we may remark
that it is certainly true; but that the business of seleuce, here, as elsewhere,
consists in resolving the complex phenomenon into simple phenomena; the
complex spiral motion into simple circular motions.’ Bacon, both here
and elsewhere, when he has occasion to treat of astronomical questions
(see, for instance, De hugmentis, iii. 4), depreciates the importance of
mathematical calculations as applied to the motions of the heavenly bodies.
And yet, without the aid of mathematice, where would have been the
modern science of Astronomy? The simultaneous discovery of the planet
Neptune by Adams and Le Verrier, as a result of the most elaborate
mathematical investigations‚ is alone a sufficient refutation of Bacon's view.
Formal Astronomy, or the consideration of the apparent motions of the
heavenly bodies in Space and Time, was an essential prelude to Physical
Astronomy, or the reference of these motions to their causes in F orce
and Matter. But, though Bacon went too far in depreciating Formal
Astronomy, we must not forget that he was one of the first to point out
the importance of Physical Astronomy, as well as of establishing a closer
union between both branches of the science: ‘Qamobrem hanc partem
Astronomiae, quae Physica est, desiderari statuimus. Eam Astronomiam
Vivam nominabimus, ad differentiam bovis illius Promethei suffarcinati, et
solummodo figura tenus bovis! De Augrn. iii. ⁴· Cp. Descriptio Globi ln·
tellectualis, cap. 5. See also Introduction, pp. 37, 38.

'¹ The distinction of higher and lower comets may be found in Seneca,
Nat. Qaest. vii. ⁶, 7, and is there referred to Epigenes. Bacon, in the De
Fluxu et Refluxu Maris (E. and S.,v01. iii. p. 53), speaks of the ‘lower
comets’ as being lower than the orb of the moon. By many ancient philo·
sophers, all comets were regarded as sublunar. lt is needless to remark
that, on the other hand, all true comets belong to the solar, and not to the
terrestria} system. ln reading ancient authors, however, it must always be
borne in mind that they often designated mere atmospheric meteors by the
name of comets.
