axiomata tanquam igne probantur, tardus mino intellectus
est, et inhabilis, nisi hoc illi per duras leges et violentum
imperium imponatur.

Gliscit &flectus humanus, neque consistere aut acquies-
cere potis est, sed ulterius petit; at frustra ⁷⁰. Itaque incogi-
tabile est ut sit aliquid extremum aut extimum mundi, sed
semper quasi necessario occurrit ut sit aliquid ulterius⁷¹.

discovery of those singular and subtle laws of electricity thch have been
gathered from the ‘remote and heterogeneous instances’ which could have
occurred only to the patient student of nature.

²⁰ The restless ambition of the intellect is one of the Impediments to
the attainment of truth. The mind ever desires to penetrate further
and further into the nature and causes of things; but in vain. And hence,
feeling its helplessness, it falls back upon itself, and supposes the processes
of nature to be carried on with the same ends and ln the same manner as
the works of man. .

This Aphorism touches on a number of philosophica! difficulties thch it
would be impossible within the limits of a work like this to discuss fully or
satisfactorily. l shall confine myself toa brief statement of my own
opInions and to such references as l think likely to be of real use to the
student.

'¹ The mInd is unable to think of the totality of space as finite; for, at
whatever point we mentally place ourselves, we cannot but think of some
point beyond it. Moreover, if space be finite, it must be bounded by some
figure, that is to say, the totality of space must, on this ,suppositiom have
some shape or other; but, whether we regard itas spherical, cubical‚ or
of any other shapc, there must be some space beyond it in relation to
which it issaid to be of this or that shapc, and ln which it is contained.
Hence, the proposition that space (in its totality) is finite or bounded,
involves a contradiction in terms; for bounded space must have some
space beyond it. But, though we are thus compelled to think of space
as infinite, can we conceive infinite space? We certaInly cannot realise,
imagIne, or pleture to ourselves infinite space, for it would take an infinity
of time to do so. But this clrcumstance constitutes no valid reason why
we should refuse to affirm a proposition, the only alternatIve of which has
been proved to be sels-contradictory. We are compellcd, therefore, to
assert the proposition that space is not finite, or, tn other words, that
space is Infinite.

similarly, we cannot think of time as having hada begInning, for then
there would be a ilme before tIme; or as about to bave an end, for then
there would be a time after time. Hence, we are compelled to affirm an
infinity of time, as we were before compelled to affirm an infinity of
space.
