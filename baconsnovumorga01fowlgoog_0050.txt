on which see my note, he absurdly speaks oi air, ‘qui super aquam
et aquea multiplicat se, et generat novum aerem,' while air, though
a fixed body in the parts immediately above the earth, is resolved
again into water in the upper regions ol the atmosphere ⁸⁵.

Connected with this idea oi the transmutability ol air and water
is the strange theory, which he appears to have received without
question, that lountains originate in the condensation of air within
he hollow parts os the earth. See Historia Densi et Rari (E and S,
rol. ii. p. 293), and Novum Organum, ii. 50 (3), with my note on
the latter passage.

The transmutability ol metals was another fancy which Bacon, in
part at least, accepted. Thus, in the Historia Densi et Rari (E. and
S, vol. ii. pp. 250, 251), though he doubts the possibility of manu·
iacturing gold, on account oi its great weight and density, he has
great hopes ol producing silver by the conversion ol lead or quick-
silver: ‘Vemm versio argenti vivi aut plumbi in argentum (cum
argentum sit illis rarius) habenda est pro sperabili; cum tantum
litationem et alia quaedam innuat, non densationem! In the Sylva
Sylvarum (Exps. 326-328), however, though he finds much lauit
with many oi the ianciiul conceits oi the Alchemists, his hopes seem
to have risen, and he actually proposes a recipe lor the purpose.
The general question oi the transformation ol bodies is discussed in
Nov. Org. ii. ,5. This lancy, or, as, perhaps, we might rather call it,
sanguine expectation, 1 am not inclined to visit very severely on
Bacon Though we may not be able to superinduco the ‘forms' ol
the various ‘simple natures' which constitute gold, yet, ii we could
discover that it was a compouud, we might be able to put together
the elements oi which it consists, and thus produce it artificially.
Moreover, an error which was shared with Boyle, whose special
business was with this class ol questions, and treated without dis·
respect by Newton³⁸, may well be pardoned to Bacon, who did not

θ’ Mr. Macvey Napier (Essay on Bacon, p. 7) calls attention to a letter t'rom
Nevvton to Oldenburg, then Secretary oi the Royal Society, on certain experiments
recently made by Boyle with reiereuoe to this subject. This letter, which contains
a gentle criticism oi Boyle's investigatione ,not unmixed wtth irony, but by no
means hearing the problem as an absurd or ‚insoluble one, is printed in the General
Dictionary, Historical and Critical, based ou Bnyle, by Bemard, Birch, δια, London,
1735, vol. iii. p. 558. Iu ibe note ou this and the preceding page are several
extracts from Boyle’s papers, letters, &n Boyle was certainly quite as much a
