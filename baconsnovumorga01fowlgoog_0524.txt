lapis, non vitrum, lignum, aqua, oleum, pannus aut corpora
librom, adr, flamma, et caetera. Attamen per probationem
exactam fortasse inveniri possit aliquod medium, quod hebetet
virtutem ipsius plusquam aliquod aliud, comparative et in
aliquo gradu: veluti quod non trahat magnes sermm per tan·
tarn crassitiem auri quam per par spatium aeris; aut per
tantum argentum ignitum quam per frigidum 3 et sic de simi·
libus. Nam dehis nos experimentum non fecimus; sed suffi-
cit tamen ut proponantur loco exempli ⁸². Similiter non
invenitur hic apud nos corpus quod non suscipiat calidum igni
approximatum. Attamen longe citius suscipit calorem aer⁸³
quam lapis. Atque talis est substitutio quae fit per Gradus.
Substitutio autem per Analoga utilis sane, sed minus certa
est3 atque idcirco curn judicio quodam adhibenda. Ea fit,
cum deducitur non-sensibile ad sensum, non per operationes

sensibiles ipsius corporis insensibilis, sed per contemplationem ’

corporis alicujus cognati sensibilis ⁸⁴. Exempli gratia: si in-
quiratur de Mistura Spirituum, qui sunt corpora non-visibilia,

⁸² l am informed that the question put by Bacon has not even yet been
answered‚ the experiment being, on account oi the various influences at
work, of the most delicate description. It is possible, however, that the
interposition ol bismuth, and the so-called ‘diamagnetic’ substances gene·
rally, might, if we had sufficiently powerlul instrumenta and sufficient
means of measurement, be found to produce a perceptible intluence in
modifying the effect of a magnet on iron at a distance. Gold and silver
are both included among the diamagnetic substances.

⁸⁸ The nature of Bacon's error with regard to air as a conductor of heat
has already been pointed out. See notes on ii. ra (18), (ao); 13 (38). lt
will be noticed how loosely Bacon speaks of ‘stone,' without distinguishing
the different kinds of ‘stones’

⁸⁴ An excellent instance in modern science would be the analogy of
vibratione or wave-motlous as applied to the phenomena of Heat, Light,
and Souud. Mr. Ellis says: ‘Du Bois Raymond's Researches in Animal
Electricity give a good example of this. He constructed what may be
called an electrical model osa muscle, and succeeded in obtaining an
illustration not only oi his fundamental result, namely that any transverse
sectiou is negative with respect to any longitudinal one, but also of the
more complicated relations between two different portioris of the same
section!

The former oi Bacon’s illustrations, it is needless to say, is purely
iancisul. The analogy, in the second case, corresponds pretty closely
with racis.
