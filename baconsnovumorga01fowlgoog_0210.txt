HOMO, naturae minister et interpres, tanturn facit et intelligit
quantum de naturae ordine re vel mente observaverit: nec
amplius scit, aut potest ¹.

¹ ‘Man, theservant and interpreter of Nature, does and understands just
so much as he has discerned conceming the order of nature by ohservation
or reflection (rr by the observation of things or of himself): nor does
he know more, or can he do more!

The precise meaning of the words revel mente observaverit is not clear.
The distinction intended may be either, as l am inclined to think is the
case, between the observation of facts and the subsequent process of medi·
tation or reflection on such observation, or between the observation of the
external world and that of our own minds‚ exter-nal and internal perception,
as they have been called. According to either interpretation, the passage
will remind the reader of the main positions in Locke's Essay, to which
it might well serve as a motto. Though the precise meaning of the words
is obscure, the purport of the Aphorism is plain. Man, if he would learn
or do anything, must carefully watch the processes of Nature, must register
and interpret her phenomena. This is his only way either to knowledge
or power.

The same sentence, with a slight variation, occurs towards the end of
the Distributio Operis. lts connection in that place with the preceding
and succeeding sentences is worthy of notice. ‘Neque enim agitur solum
felicitas contemplativa, sed vere res humanae et fortunae, atque omnis
operum potentia. Homo enim naturae minister et interpres tautum
facit et intelligit, quantum de naturae ordine, opere vel mente, observaverit:
nec amplius scit, aut potest. Neque enim ullae vires causarum catenam
solvere aut perfringere possint, neque natura aliter quam parendo vincitur.’
