INTRODUCTION. 117

Leaming ‘in the universities here and the English colleges abroad,'
we have still sufficient evidence to shew that his works were producing
a real and perceptible influence.

The ready welcome accorded to the London sanans in Oxford in ⁴
1648 and 1649 (see Wallis’s account), the fact that they were j0ined
by several Oxlord men, and the uninterrupted meetings of the

incipient Royal Society in Oxford tili the dispersion of several of its
members in 1658, would alone furnish satisfactory evidence of the
spread of the ‘New Philosophy’ in one, at least, of the Universities”.
But Bp. Sprat expressly tells us (p. 53) that, besides being ‘frequented
by some Gentlemen of Philosophical Minds, whom the misfortunes of
the Kingdom and the security and ease of a retirement amongst
Gown·men had drawn thither,’ ‘the University had, at that time, many
members of its own, who had begun a free way of reasoning,' an
expression which undoubtedly denotas the Baconian, as opposed to
the Aristotelian or traditional method. In describing their meetings,
he proceeds: ‘By this means there was a race of young men pro·
vided, against the next age, whose minds, receiving from them their
first impressions ol sober and generous knowledge, were invincibly
armed against all the enchantments of Enthusiasm. But what is
more, 1 may venture to affirm, that it was in good measure hythe
influence, which these Gentlemen had over the rest, that the University
itself, or, at least, any part of its Discipline and Order, was saved
from min!

At a period a little later than the publication of Sprat's book,
Dr. Beal, writing to Boyle‚ Nov. 27, 1671, has a passage which will
be read with some interest by many Oxford men, and which, as 1
have not seen it noticed before, I transcribe at length:

beginnings, and the wheel once set on going, rnen shall suck more truth out of
Christian pens, than hitherto they have done out ol heathen. 1 say with hope,
because 1 hear my former book of the Advanoement of [naming is well tasted in
the Universitiae here and the English collegas abroad: and this [the Novum
organum] is the same argument sunit deeper.' Letter to the King, in 1620, printed
in Spedding’s Life and Letters, vol. vii. pp.119,120.

² And yet the Juniors do not seem, at any rate in some of the Colleges. to have
profited much from this intellectual activity oi their seniors. See Ioclre's account
of the arid and unstimulating character ol his studies during the earlier years of his
academical life, as given in his confidences to Lady Masham and Le Clerc (Fox
Boume's Life of Locke, vol. i. pp. 47, 48). In referring to Mr. Fox Boume's
work, 1 must not be supposed to endorse altogether his account of the Oxford cur·
riculum at this time, much ol which appears to me to be an ideal constmction.
