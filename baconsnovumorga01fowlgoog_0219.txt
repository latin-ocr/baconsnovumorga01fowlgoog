inveniendam veritatem. Altera a sensu et particularibus
advolat ad axiomata maxime generalia, atque ex iis prin-

particulars, Bacon complains, men usually fly off to the widest gene·
ralisations, and then acquiesce in these, as if they were so many indubitable
truths. But, iu considering this frequent source of error, he does not per·
ceive that rapid generalisation is often indispensable to the scientific
enquirer. The fault does not consist so much in making rapid gene·
ralisations as in acquiescing too readily and confidently in them, when
made. The method of gradual and continuous ascent from particulars
to the highest axioms, through all the intermediate steps, which is here
commended by Bacon, is not the method which, for the most part, has
been actually pursued by the most successful investigators of Nature, nor
would its general adoption contribute to the advancement of science.
Provided a hypothesis be regarded simply as a hypothesis, and not assumed
astrue without a rigorous investigation, the mere fact of its generality
ought to be no objection to it. lndeed, by stimulating enquiry and
directing its course, it is plain that a very general hypothesis, such as
the theory of universal gravitation, or Laplace's nebular hypothesis, or
the ware-theory of light and sound, or the theory of evolution, or the
theory of final causes, even iu its cruder forms, may, whether ultimately
proved to be true or false, be of the utmost service in the investigation
even of small groups of facts. The all-important proviso, of course, is
that, till proved, such a hypothesis must be taken simply quantum valeat,
as a hypothesis and no more. lt would be far from an advantage to
science, to restrain the flights of scientitic imagination, but the products
of imagination must never be confounded with the results of proof. The
fantastic character of the Ancient Physics was due far less to an exuberant
imagination than to a defective sense of evidence. And the true remedy
was to insist on the necessity of verification rather than on the suppression
of hypothesis.

There is, therefore, a third way of investigation which is not open to
Bacon's animadversions and which is peculiarly the way of genius. lt
begins, like the other tw0, with the observation of particulars, for this
always is and must be the first step, and then, by an effort of imagina-
tion, frames for itself some explanation which has afar wider range of
application than the special class of phenomena which has been observed.
This axioma maxime generale is regarded as a hypothesis, to be hereafter
proved or disproved, but, meanwhile, it serves as a provisional explanation
of the facts, and stimulates to further investigations. From it may be
deduced a number of axiomata media which admit of being constantly
compared with facts, and thus an ever-increasing experience tends to
prove or disprove the axiom in question. lf facts do not agree with
the deductions from the hypothesis, it must be thrown aside as useless
or modified to meet the exceptions3 but if it agree with the facts, there
is a strong presumption in its favour. Even still, however, it must not
be finally admitted as an ascertained trutb, till it has been shewn to
conform to the rigorous requirements of the inductive methods, or con-
