220 NOVUM ORGANUM.

ex impotentia cogitationis. At majore cum pernicie inter·
venit haec impotentia mentis in inventione causarum: nam
cum maxime universalia in natura positiva ⁷³ esse debeant,
quemadmodum inveniuntur, neque sunt revera causabilia;
tamen intellectus humanus, nescius acquiescere, adhuc appetit
notiora⁷⁴. Tum vero, ad ulteriora tendens, ad proximiora
recidit, videlicet ad causas finales ⁷⁵, quae sunt plane ex
natura hominis, potius quam universi: atque ex hoc sonte
philosophiam miris modis corruperunt. Est autem aeque
imperiti et leviter philosophantis, in maxime universalibus

mentally take our position at some particular point or moment, usually the
present, and try to conceive ol an endless regress or an endless progress, as
the case may he, from that point or moment. The endless progressis
the irpinitum a parte ante, the endless regress the irfinitum a parte post.

⁷³ This passage is obscure, but its meaning appears to be that there
are certain great laws of nature, or causes, or, as Bacon would probably
have said, ‘forms' in which we ought to acquiesce as ultimate explanations ι
of laets. Such, to take instances lrom modern science, may, perhaps, be the
law ol gravity, the law of inertia, and the laws oi chemical combination.
‘Now Bacon can hardly mean that these laws, causes, or forms are them·
selves, as a matter of fact, due to no other cause, but what he does
probably mean is that it isin vain sorus to inquire into their cause:
to us they are and must be ultimate facts, to be taken for granted, and
it is mere idle speculation to try and trace the course os nature beyond
them. Cp. with this passage, 11. 48 (14), and specially De hugmentis,
lib. ix. (E. and S., vol. i. p. 833. l. ro, etc.) See also Introduction, pp.
⁶2, ⁶3·

The word ‘positiva’ may be translated ‘absolute’ or ‘ultimate' lt
seems intended to express the opposite os ‘relative’ or ‘dependent’
that is, relative to or dependent on other causes. These facts are ‘to
be taken for granted' instead of ‘to be explained)

²⁴ That is, natura notiora or ‘still more general laws!

⁷⁸ For the meaning of the expression ‘ F inal Causas,’ the reader may
refer to the first root-note on ς 8 of the Introduction, and, lor Bacon’s
criticism of the doctrine, to t ro.

Man projects his own aims and ideas on the Universa, and regards
God or Nature as acting in the same way in which he would act him·
sels. Thus, instead ol accommodating his thoughts to Nature, he accom-
modates Nature to his own thoughts. Compare what is said by one oi the
interlocutors in Galileo's Third Dialogue: ‘Great in my judgment. is the
folly of those who would have had God to have made the World more pro-
portional to the narrow capacities oi their reason, than to his immense,
yea infinite power.' (Sir Thomas Salusbury’s Tmnslation, p. 333.)
