³⁷ ‘Compare this with the passage in the Descriptio Globi Intellectualis
(0. v.) where Bacon speaks 01 Galileo's invention and discoveries (the first-
iruits of which had just been announced) in a strain 01 more sanguine
expectation: “Atque hoc inceptum et fine et aggressu nobile quoddam et
humano genere dimum esse existimamus: eo magis quod hujusmodi ho·
mines et ausu laudandi sint et tide3 quod ingenue et perspicue propo·
suerunt, quomodo singula illis constiterint. Superest tantum constantia,
cum magna judicii severitate, ut et instrumenta mutent, et testium nurne-
rnm augeant, et singula et saepe experiantur, et rarie3 denique ut et sibi
ipsi objiciant et aliis patefaciant quid in contrarium objici possit, et tenuis·
simum quemque scrupulum non spemant; ne forte illis eveniat, quod
Democriti et aniculae suae evenit circa ficus mellitas, ut vetula esset philo-
sopho prudentior, et magnae et admirabilis speculationis causae subesset
error quispiam tenuis et ridiculus.'’ From this passage, written eight years
before, we may leam (1 thinlr) why it was that Bacon had now begun to
doubt how far these observatione could be trusted. Believing, as he did,
that all the received theories of the hearens were full of error, assoon as
he heard that by means of the telescope men could really see so much
further into the heavens than before, he was prepared to hear 01 a great
number of new and nnexpected phenomena; and his only fear was that
the observers, instead of following out their observations patiently and
carehrlly, would begin to form new theories. But now that nine years had
passed since the discovery 01 Jupiter's satellites, the spots in the sun, ac,
and no new discovery 01 importance had been announced‚ he wondered
how it could be that men seeing so much further should be able to see so
little more than they did, and began to suspect that it was owing to some
deiect either in‘the instrument or in the methods of observation.’ This
note l haveborrowed from Mr. Spedding.

³³ See Mullach, Democriti Fragmenta, p. 39¹· Amongst other authors
he quotes Stobaeus‚ Ecl. Phys. p. 576: Δημόκριτος (τὸ γάλα ἔφη εἶναι) πολλῶν
καὶ μικρῶν καὶ συνεχῶν ἀστέρων, συμφωτιζομένων ἀλλήλοις, διὰ τὴν πύκνωσιν,
συναυγασμόν. Cp. Arist. Meteor. i. 8 (p. 345 a), where the same opinion
is also attributed to Anaxagoras and his followers. See also Manilius, i.
7²5-323 Ovid, Met. i. 168, dte.

Democritus also maintained that the moon isa solid body, and that the
marks on its face represent mountains and valleys.
