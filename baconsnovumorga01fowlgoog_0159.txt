‘The great glory oi literature in this island, during the reign oi
James, was Lord Bacon. Most of his performances were composed
in Latin; though he possessed neither the eleganee oi that, nor of '
his native tongue. Is we consider the variety ol talents displayed by
this man, as a public speaker,a man ol business, a wit, a courtier,
a companion‚ an author, a philosopher, he is justly the objectos great
admiration. 1f we consider him merely as an author and philosopher,
the light in which we view hirn at present, though very estirnable, he
was yet inferior to his cotemporary Galile0, perhaps even to Kepler.
Bacon pointed out at a distance the road to true philosophy: Galileo
both pointed it out to others, and made himself considerable advances
in it The Englishman was ignorant ol geometry: the Florentine
revived that science, excelled in it, and was the first that applied it,
together with experiment, to natural philosophy. The former rejected,
with the most positive disdain, the system of Copernicus: the latter
lortified it with new procis, derived both from reason 3ηά the senses.
Bacon's style is stili and rigid: his wit, though often brilliant, is also
often unnatural and' far-setched3 and he seems to be the original of
those pointed similes and long-spun allegorice, which so much dis-
tinguish the English authors: Galileo is a lively and agreeable,
though somewhat a prolix, writer. But Italy, not united in any single
governmeut, and perhaps satiated with that literary glory which it
has possessed both in ancient and modern times, has too much
neglected the renown which it has acquired, by giving birth to so
great a man. That national spirit which prevails among the English,
and which forms their great happiness is the cause why they bestow
on all their eminent writers, and on Bacon among the rest, such
praises and acclamations, as may often appear partial and excessivev!

The excessive praise bestowed on Bacon by Voltaire and the
EncyclopedistS, though met at first by the argument that they did
not truly represent the views of Bacon, at last provolred a violent
reaction, to which the well-known worlr of Count Joseph de Maistre
gave expression. This work, entitled Examen de la Philosophia de
Bacon, was published posthumously at ParIs and Lyons in 1836,
