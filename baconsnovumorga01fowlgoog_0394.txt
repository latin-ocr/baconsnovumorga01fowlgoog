LIB. II. 12. 371

Venrm hujusmodi motus non est tam rapidus ut excitet
calorem, et fit secundum totum, non per particulas ¹⁷3 ut
mirum non sit, si non generet calorem.

Ad 1⁷¹⁸ 2³·- Circa hanc instantiam facienda est inquisitio dili-
gentior. Videntur enim herbae et vegetabilia viridia et hu-
mida aliquid habere in se occulti caloris. Ille vero calor tam
tenuis est ut in singulis non percipiatur ad tactum: verum
postquam illa adunata sint et conclusa, ut spiritus ipsorum
non expiret in aeirem sed se invicem foveat, tum vero oritur
calor manifestus, et nonnunquam flamma in materia congrua¹⁸.

Ad 1⁸¹² 2⁴·- Etiam circa hanc instantiam diligentior facienda
est inquisitio. Videtur enim calx viva aqua aspersa concipere
calorem vel propter unionem caloris qui antea distrahebatur
(ut ante dictum est de herbis conclusis), vel ob irritationem
et exasperationem spiritus ignei ab aqua, ut hat quidam con·
flictus et antiperistasis19. Utra vero res sit in causa facilius

surrouuding atmosphere were more nearly of the same temperature with
itself.

¹⁷ ΜΓ. Kitchin says: ‘By this, 1 suppose, Bacon means, it affects the
whole body generally, and does not cause friction of its separate particles.
This view isof course wrong!

¹³ This is a well-known phenomenon, as in damp hay-ricls, coar-dost,
beaps of decaying vegetable matter, masses of rags or tow saturated with
oil‚ dcc. Bacon’s explanation, it is unnecessary to say, is wholly unscientific.
The following is given in Watts’ Dictionary of Chemistry, art. Combus-
tion: ‘The substance absorbs and condenses the air within its pores3
oxidation then commences immediately and raises the temperature, which
again accelerates the oxidation; and thus the process goes on with cou-
tinually increasing rapidity, till at length the mass bursts into llame. The
low conducting power of such a porous mass greatly facilitates the com-
bustim, by preventing the dissipation of the beat generated. * * * *
The presence of molsture greatly promotes the spontaneous ignitiou of
porous substances, such as hay or coal-dust, the water probably supplying
oxygen to the combustible matter.’ Where the masses are small, the hear
developed is usually carried off 3 so that combustion, in materials of this
character, is far more likely to take place in large masses thau small.
Thus, in a hay-rich the process may be arrested by pulling the rick to
preces.

¹⁹ The reason is that the water enters into combination with the quick-
lime, which has a powerful affinity for it, and that beat is developed in the
process.

The word ‘autiperistasis’ is defined in ii. 27 ad fin. as ‘reiectio naturae
contrariae.’ Cp. note on that passage.
