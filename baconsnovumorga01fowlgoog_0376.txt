Posito itaque doctrinae scopo, pergendum ad praecepta;
idque ordine minime perverso aut perturbato. Atque indicia
, de interpretatione naturae complectuntur partes in genere
duas⁵⁶3 primam, de educendis aut excitandis axiomatibus ab
experientia ; secundam, de deducendis aut derivandis experi-
mentis novis ab axiomatibus. Prior autem trifariam dividi· '
tur: in tres nempe ministrationes; ministrationem ad sensum,

ministrationem ad memoriam, et ministrationem ad mentem

sive rationem ⁵⁰.
Primo enim paranda est historia naturalis et experimentalis,

sufficiens et bona3 quod fundamentum rei est: neque enim
fingendum, aut excogitandum, sed inveniendum, quid natura
iaciat aut serat.

‘⁴ Cp. De augmentis, iii. 5, which will fumish a full explanation of this
kimie·

⁶⁶ Namely, Induction and Deduction. On the latter meth0d‚ the Novum
organum, in its fragmentary state, contains nothing (unless we except the
instantes mentioned in ii. 52, as conducing ‘ad operativam'), though the
seventh, ninth, and possibly fourth parts (see Aph. 21) were to deal with
this subject.

M. Bouiilet remarks that, in the Partis Secundae Delineatio, the Pars
Actlva is distinguished from the Deductive branch of the Pars Contem-
platira, whereas here the two are spoken of as one. See E. and S, vol. iii.
pp. 556-7· M. Bouiilet also remarks that it is doubtful whether Bacon
would hare found in the practical or operative part sufficient matter for a
special treatise, bearing iu mind what he himself says: ‘iuter contem·
plativam partem activam perpetuo intercurrere· (Partis Secundae Deli·
neatio, E. aud S., rol. iil. p. 55⁶)-

“ This division, as given in the present passage, is easily explicable.
The ‘ministratio ad sensum’ supplies a collection of observatione and
experimenta ‘Historia Naturalis et Experimentalis! The ‘ministratio
ad memoriam' arranges these in Tables, in a form adapted lor use. The
‘ministratio ad mentem sive rationem' is the process of Induction itself,
drawing from the tables the inferences to which they legitimately lead.
hl. Bouiilet has a long note on the mode in which the two first ‘minis-
trationes' may be supplied from different parts of Bacon's works.

On the discrepancy between the account of these ‘ministrationes’ as
given here and in the Partis Secundae Delineatio, the student, who is
curious to trace the growth of Bacon’s doctrine, may referto Mr. Sped·
ding’s note on the present passage and to the General Preface, prefixed to
the rst vol. of Ellis and Spedding’s Edition, i io.
