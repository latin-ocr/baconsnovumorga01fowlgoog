he could not fail to notice the attacks on Aristotle (referred to in 'the
last section) and the constant appeals to sense and experience. The
very title of the first of Telesius’ nine books ‘De Rerum Natura’
is sufficient to shew the spirit in which he writes: ‘Mundi Con·
structionem, Corporumque in eo Contentorum Magnitudinem, Natur-
amque non ratione, quod antiquioribus facturn est, inquirendam, sed
sensu percipiendam, et ab ipsis habendam esse rebus' In the
>Prooemium to the same work, he speaks, much in the sarne tone
as Bacon does afterwards of those who ‘veluti cum Deo de sapientia
contendentes decertantesque, mundi ipsius principia et causas ratione
inquirere ausi, et quae non invenerant inventa ea sibi esse exis·
timantes, volentesque veluti suo arbitratu mundum effinxere! And
again: ‘non scilicet eo usque sibi homines placere‚et eousque animo
efferri oportebat, ut veluti naturae praeeuntes [compare Bacon's
“anticipatio naturae ''], et Dei ipsius non sapientiam modu, sed
potentiam etiam affectantes, ea ipsi rebus darent, quae rebus inesse
intuiti non forent, et quae ab ipsis omnino habenda erant rebus!
ln opposition to this ambitious method, he declares his own intention
of following only sense and nature : ‘sensum videlicet nos, et naturam,
aliud praeterea nihil sequuti sumus, quae perpetuo sibi ipsi concors,
idem semper et eodem agit modo. atque idern semper operatur!
In book viii, where he discusses the nature of knowledge, he lays
down, amongst others, the following propositions: ‘Scientiarum
omniurn et geometriae ipsius principia a sensu haberi, vel proxima
eorum, quae sensu percepta sunt, similitudine, et conclusiones omnes
ex iis pendere' (cap. 4); ‘Conclusiones naturales in eo mathematicis
praestare, quod hae a signo omnes, illae vero a propriis causis
propriisque manant principiis! (cap. 5.) Here, and elsewhere in
this Book, Telesius enunciates the principle of the origin of all
knowledge in the perceptions of the senses, at least as distinctly,
if not more distinctly, than Bacon himself. With regard to individual
doctrines, I shall, from time to time, draw attention in the notes to
many points of agreement between Bacon and Telesius, but I am
not aware that, as regards method, there is anything more to notice
than the general agreement which I have already pointed out There
is, sofar as 1 am aware, no attempt in the works of Telesius to
analyse induction, or to give any specific mles for its right
conduct

The origin of knowledge in the perceptions of the senses and the
consequent importante of experience seems to have been a common-
