LIB. II. 48. 533

cx desiderio partium homogeneamm cotundi, adjuvante tantum
calore ad discutiendum torporem, qui torpor desiderium illud
antea ligaverat. Quoad vero auxilium virtutis inditae a corpore
cognato; illud mirabiliter elucescit in magnete armato, qui
excitat in ferro virtutem detinendi ferrum per similitudinem
substantiae, discusso torpore ferri per virtutem magnetis.
Quoad vero auxilium motus3 conspicitur illud in sagittis
ligneis, cuspide etiam lignea, quae altius penetrant in alia
ligna quam si luissent armatae serso, per similitudinem
substantiae, discusso torpore ligni per motum celerem: de

quibus duobus experimentis etiam in aphorismo de instantiis
clandestinis diximus ⁸⁵.

Ligatio vero motus congregationis minoris, quae fit per
fraenum eorporis dominantis, conspicitur in solutione sanguinis
et urinarum ⁸⁶ per frigus. Quamdiu enim repleta luerint
corpora illa spiritu agili ⁸⁷, qui singulas eorum partes cujus·
cunque generis ipse ut dominus totius ordinat et cohibet,
tamdiu non coeunt heterogenea⁸⁸ propter fraenum; sed
postquam ille spiritus evaporaverit, aut suffocatus luerit per

uo idea of the true relation ol beat and cold, as ,different degrees of the
same phenomenon. The phrase ‘change of temperature’ would include
both, and it might have supplied him with a hey to his difficulties.

⁸⁶ See ii. 25 ad nn, with notes.

⁸⁶ With regard to urine, as affected by cold, see Dr. Watson’s Lectures
on the Principles and Praetice ol Physic‚ 5th Ed, Lect. 70, vol. ii. p. 702.

As to blood, Bacon isin error. ‘So iar from coagulation being pro·
moted by cold,’ says Dr. Carpenter (Principles of Human Physiology, 8th
Ed, p. 272), ‘it can be shown to be accelerated by moderate warmth, the
natural beatos the body from which the blood is taken appearing to be
most lavourable to it; but the coagulating power appears to be destroyed
by a temperature of about 150⁰, blood heated to tbat point remaining per-
manently fluid.’ Bacon was, oi course, deceived by seeing the blood
gradually coagulato after being talren from the body, the decreasing
temperatum, which was only a concomitant of coagulation, occurring to
him as the cause.

θ’ lt is needless to add anything to what l hare already said on Bacon's
conception of ‘spirit’ in the notes on i. 50, ii. 40, and elsewhere.

⁸³ This word should, perhaps, be ‘homogenea,' as Mr. Ellis suggests.
But ‘heterogenea' seems intelligible enough, in the sense of ‘different
parts! Cp. the expression ‘omnia solvuntur et redeunt in heterogeneas
suas, sive (si placet) elementa sua3’ in the passage referred to just below.
