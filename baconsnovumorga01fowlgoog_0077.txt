be cleared from'his path. Iwas at one time inclined' to think that,¹
in various parts ol his works, he attached to it two entirely distinct
meanings, which may be represented roughly by ‘ cause’ and ‘essence‚'
but, as will appear from the sequel, Ι am now ol opinion that, though
the word has undoubtedly various shades os meaning in different
places, all these admit ol derivation lrom a single conception The
best course ol proceeding, however, will be, first, to collect the
more important passages in which he attempts either to define the
term, or to state with precision the sense in which he accepts or
does not accept the investigation ol ‘forms' as a legitimate branch
of his own philosophy.

The most striking passage ol all, perhaps, is that in Nov. Org. i.
51: ‘Intellectus humanus fertur ad abstracta propter naturam pro·
priam. * * * * Materia potius considerari debet, et ejus schematismi,
et meta-schematismi, atque actus purus, et lex actus sive motus;
Formae enirn commenta animi humani sunt, nisi libeat leges illas
actus Formas appellare! In strong contrast with this, is the passage
in De Augmentis. iii. 4 (E. and S., vol. i. pp. 564-568), where he
states ‘inventionem Formarum ex omnibus scientiae partibus dig·
nissimam esse quae investigetur, si modo lieri possit ut reperiantur.
Ad inventionis possibilitatem vero quod attinet, sunt certe ignavi
regionum exploratores qui ubi nil nisi coelum et pontum vident,
terras ultra esse prorsus negant! This passage (which is far too
long to be quoted at length) is well worthy of the student’s attention,
and should be read with care ³¹. 1 may specially refer to the following

product, be it the statue, man, lile, mind, health, or what not The efficient
cause is that by the instrumentality ol which lorm supervenes upon matter,
as, lor instance, in the mse nithe statue, the sculptor, or, in the case ol health,
the medical art, or, in the case ol the universe at large, God or voire. The
final cause (and it is always assumed by Aristotle that there is one; οὐδὲν
μάτην ἡ plote rores) is that lor-which the object existe. the end it subserves, es,
sor instance. in the oese os a statue, the pleasure or improvement os man, in the
ease ol the bones ol an animal, the support oi the body and the protection ot its
softer parts, in the case ol the state. the wellare ol the citizens, and so on.

The student who requires further information should consult Ueherweg, Zeller, or
some other History os Philosophy. He should also read, with special attention,
Phys. ii. 3 (repeated in Metaph. iv. (v.) a), Metaph. i. 3, and An. Post. ii. 11. On
the question ol the coincidences which sometimes exist amongst these Canem. and
other difficulties, Ι have not entered. Nor do 1 think it would be of any servioe to
draw out the differences ol meaning in these terms as employed by Bacon end aa
employed by Aristotle. The student, who is even moderately acquainted with both
authors, can easily, il he has the ctrriosity, do this lor himself.

⁸¹ The passage is to be iound with little variation in the much earlier work, the
Advencement oi learning, published in 1605. See bk. ii. (E. and S.. vol. iit.
