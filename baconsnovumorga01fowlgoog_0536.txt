At solidiora, sicca, aut magis compacta, qualia sunt lapides
et ligna, necnon metalla, multo adhuc minorem compressionem
aut extensionem, et lere imperceptibilem serunt²¹3 sed vel
fractione, vel progressione, vel aliis pertentationibus se liberant:

‘This’ says Mr. Ellis, ‘is perhaps the most remarkable ol Bacon's
experiments3 and it is singular that it was so little spoken of by sub·
sequent writers. Nearly filty years alter the publication ol the Novum
organum, an account ola similar experiment was published by Megalotti,
who was secretary of the Accademia del Cimento at Florence; and it has
since been familiarly known as the Florentlne experiment. l quote his
account of it. ‘Facemmo lavorar di getto una grande ma sottil palla
d’ argento, e quella ripiena d' acqua raffreddata col ghiaccio serramo con
saldlssime vite. Di poi cominciammo a martellaria leggiermente per ogni
verso, onde ammaccato 1' argento (il quale per la sua crudezza non com·
porta d'assottigliarsi e distendersi come farebbe l'oro raihnato, o ll piombo,
o altro metallo pih dolce) veniva a ristrignersl‚ e scemare la sua interna
capacite, senza che l’acqua patlsse una minima compressione, poiche ad
ogni colpo si videa trasudare per tutti i pori del metallo a gulsa d’ argento
rivo il quale da alcuna pelle premuto minutamente sprizzasse.’-Saggi tli
naturali Esperienze fatte nell' Accademia delcimento, p. 204,Fhenze,r6tt7.
The writer goes on to remark that the absolute incompressibility of water
is not proved by this experiment, but merely that it is not to be com-
pressed in the manner described. But the experiment is on other grounds
incouclusive.

‘lt is to be remarked that Leibnitz, Nouveaux Essais‚ in mentioning the
Florentine experiment, says that the globe was oi gold (p. 229, Erdmann),
whereas the F lorentine academiclans expressly say why they preferred
silver to either gold or lead!

Notwithstanding the unsatisfactory character ol these experiments, the
compressibillty of liquids has been fully demonstrated by Cantor, Oersted,
and others. For an account ol ¹the piezomerer, the instrument which is
rrsed lor measuring the amount of compressihillty of various liquids, see
Gauot's Physics, 7th Ed, l 94. Ether is much more compressible than
water, and fresh water distinctly more so than sea water. 'ln general, the
deusest liquids are those 'least capable ol compression.

¹¹ Comprsssibility seems to be an universal property of matter, being at
once a consequence and aproofof porosity. The compressibllty of solida,
though much less than that of geses, is greater, often much greater, than
that of liquids. ‘lt is found in all degrees. Cloths, paper, cork, woods
are amongst the most compressible of solid substances. Metals are so also
to e great extent, as is proved by the process of coining, in which the
metal receives the impresslon from the die. There is, ln most essese
limit beyond which, when the pressure is increased, bodies are fractured or
reduced to powder.’ Ganot’s Physics, § 16.
