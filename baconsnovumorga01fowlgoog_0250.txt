cuisset, confinxit statim philosophiam consentaneam rei apud

LV.

Maximum et velut radicale discrimen ingeniorum, quoad
philosophiam et scientias, illud est; quod alia ingenia sint
fortiora et aptiora ad notandas rerum differentias; alia, ad
notandas rerum similitudines ⁹³. Ingenia enim constantia et
acuta figere contemplationes, et morari, et haerere in omni
subtilitate differentiarum possunt: ingenia autem sublimia et
discursiva etiam tenuissimas et catholicas rerum similitudines
et agnoscunt et componunt: utrumque autem ingenium facile
labitur in excessum, prensando aut gradus rerum, aut umbras.

⁸² William Gilbert of Colchester(1540-1603), Court-Physician to Qeen
Elisabeth and author of the celebrated treatise ‘De Magnete’ published in
1600, was really the founder of the sciences of Electricity and Magnetism.
lt is, however, indisputable that he regarded his discoveries as admitting of a
widerapplication than was really the case. Thus, he assigned to magnetism
some of the phenomena which were afterwards explained by gravitation.

Gilbert (who is repeatedly referred to by Bacon both in the Novum
Organum and elsewhere) is mentioned with more respect in Bk. ii.
Aph. 35, and with considerable respect in Bk. il. Aph. 36. Mr. Spedding
r observes (vol. iii. p. 516): ‘Bacon praises him both for his industry and
his method3 censuriug him only for endeavouring to build a universal
philosophy upon so narrow a basis! Thus, in the following quaint passage
(from the ‘Aditus ad Historiam Gravis et Levis‚’ E. and 8., vol. ii. p. 80),
he combines both praise and blame: ‘ltaque vires magneticas non inscite
introduxit Gilbertus‚ sed et ipse factus magnes; nimio scilicet plura quam
oportet ad illas trahens, et navem aedificans en scalmo!

'³ This Aphorism issuggestive of an important psychological fact. The
tendency to note resemblances and the tendency to note differences rarely
co-exist in an equal degree. Men who have atendency tonote resemblances
rather thau differences have an imaginative, and frequently a philosophical
or poetical tum of mind; men who have a tendency to note differences
rather than resemblances have a logical or critical turn of mind. Plato,
Shalrspeare, and Bacon himself are good instances of the one tendency,
Aristotle of the other. As literature accumulates‚ and thought tends to
lose its freshness, men seem to be apt to note differences rather than
resemblances. Logic and criticism advance at the expense of poetry and
creative philosophy.

Wit has frequently been defined as a faculty of noticing remote
resemblances.

The student may compare with this Aphorism a passage in Kant's
Kritit der Reinen Vemunlt‚ Anhang zur transcendentalen Dialelrtilr, cd.
Hartensteiu‚ vol. iii. p. 442 (Meilrlejohn's English Translation, p. 401).
