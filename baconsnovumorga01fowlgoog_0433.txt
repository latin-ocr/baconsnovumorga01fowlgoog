migrat ad generationem, cum prius non existeret3 aut contra
migrat ad corruptionem, cum prius existeret. Itaque in
utraque antistrophe, instantiae tales sunt semper geminae 39;
vel potius una instantia in motu sive transitu, producta ad
periodum adversam. At hujusmodi instantiae non solum
accelerant et roborant exclusivum, sed etiam compellunt
affirmativam sive formam ipsam in angustum. Necesse est
enim ut¹ forma rei sit quippiam, quod per hujusmodi magra·
tz'onem indatur, aut contra per hujusmodi migrationem tollatur
et destruatur. Atque licet omnis exclusio promoveat affirma·
tr'uum, tamen hoc magis directe fit in subjecto eodem quam
in diversis. Forma autem (ut ex omnibus quae dicta sunt
manifesto liquet) prodens se in uno ducit ad omnia. Quo
autem simplicior suerit migratis), eo magis habenda est instantia
in pretio. Praeterea Instanticn Migrantes magni sunt usus
ad partem operativam; quia cum proponant sormam copu-
latam cum efficiente aut privante, perspicue designant praxin

transparency upon the exclusion of the air, and admission of water.
In reading this, and many other instances in the Novum 0rgannm, one
would almost suppose (had it been written) that its author had taken
them from Newton's Optics.

‘The travelling instances, as well as what Bacon terms “frontier in·
stances,'' are cases in which we are enabled to trace that general law
which seems to pervade all nature-the law, as it is termed‚ of continuity,
which is expressed in the well-known sentence, “Natura non agit per
saltum.'’' Herschel, tt 198, 199.

Professor Playfair remarks: ‘The mineral kingdom is the great theatre
of the instantiae migrantes, where the same nature is seen in all gradatione,
from the most perfect state, till it become entirely evanescent. Such are
the shells which we see so perfect in figure aad structure in limestone, and
gradually losing themselves in the finer marbles, till they can no longer be
distinguished. The use, also, of one such fact to explain or interpret
another, is nowhere so well seen as in the history of the mineral kingdom?

lt may be added, however, that the application ot this method to eom·
parative anatomy‚ to physiology, aad to the comparative study of law,
morals, politica, art, &c., is, at least, as interesting and instructive as its
application to miaeralogy. See my Inductive Logic under the head of
‘Method os Concomitant Variations.¹

At the instant when the phenomenon is actually generated, or actually
vanishes, the instance falls under the Method of Difference. See note
4⁶ below.

³⁹ That is, as one quality is making its appearance, the other is vahish-
ing; thus, as transparency vanishes, whiteness appears, and viee versa.
