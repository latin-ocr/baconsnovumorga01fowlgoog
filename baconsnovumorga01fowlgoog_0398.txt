piatur aliqua natura pro vera forma, nisi perpetuo decrescat
quando natura ipsa decrescit, et similiter perpetuo augeatur
quando natura ipsa augeturffl. Hanc itaque tabulam Tabu-
lam Graduum sive Tabulam Comparativae appellare consue-
vimus

Tabula Graduum sive comparativae in Calido.

Primo itaque dicemus de iis quae nullum prorsus gradum
caloris habent ad tactum, sed videntur habere potentialem
tantum quendam calorem, sive dispositionem ⁴et praepara-
tionem ad calidum. Postea demum descendemus ad ea quae
sunt actu sive ad tactum calida, eorumque fortitudines et
gradus ¹

1. In corporibus solidis et tangibilibus non invenitur aliquid
quod in natura sua calidum sit originaliter³1. Non enim lapis
aliquiS, non metallum, non sulphur, non fossile aliquod, non
lignum, non aqua, non cadaver animalis, inveniuntur calida.
Aquae autem calidae in balneis videntur calefieri per acci-
denS, sive per flammam aut ignem subterraneum, qualis ex
Aetna et montibus aliis compluribus evomitur, sive ex con·
flictu corporum, quemadmodum calor fit in ferri et stanni

own inmost nature. Thus, heat, as affecting the senses, is ‘in ordine ad
hominem,’ while its cause or essence, a motion of a certain kind amongst
the minute particles ol matter, is ‘in ordine ad universum! Aristotle’s
distinction of πρότερα or γνωριμώτερα πρὸς ἡμᾶς and πρότερα or γνωριμώτερα
τῇ φύσει, as applied respectively to individuals and species, is, it will be
noticed, here transferred to the relation of an effect to its cause ora
phenomenon to its essence.

³⁰ This rule, so lar as it affects the relation ol cause and effect, ls vitiated
by the consideration of the Plurality of Causes. As an effect may be
due to two or more distinct causes, being sometimes produced by one and
sometimes by another, it is quite conceivable that one of the causes might
remain altogether unchanged, while the effect increased or diminished
concurrently with the other cause or with one of the other causes. This
objection does not apply to the Canon of the Method ol Concomitant
Variations as stated by Mr. Mill or myself.

⁸¹ What Bacon means is that there is no tangible body which, in its
ordinary condition, affects the skln with the sensatlon ol heat. The
purely relative and negative character of ‘cold,’ and the laws of radiation
and conduction, we must recollect, were alike unknown to him.

By ‘cold' Bacon, ol course, means a temperature lower than that of
the skin.
