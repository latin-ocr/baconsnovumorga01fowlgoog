unlihely, as M. Ba'rthelemy Saint-Hilaire⁸⁸ suggests, that his sojoum
in Paris, where Ramism was then in the air, may have had a con-
siderable influence in determining the philosophica} position which he
afterwards assumed.

At this time, the spirit of revolt against Aristotle was everywhere in
the ascendant Bernardino Telesio of Cosenza (b. 1509, d. 1588),
whom Bacon pronounced the ‘best ol the novellists,' and to whom he
makes c'onstant reference throughout his worhs, invariably criticises
Aristotle with the utmost freedom. The reader who is curious to see
the direction which this criticism takes, and the tone in which itis
conducted, may refer to the Prooemium to the two boolrs ‘De Rerum
Natura juxta propria principia,' tte.. and to the Dedication prefixed to
the nine boolrs bearing the same title. In the latter he says ol the
Aristotelian philosophy: ‘et sensui, et sibi etiam ipsi, quin et Deo
Opt Mar. passim repugnat! His tone, however, compared with that
of Ramus, is unusually moderate and respectiul ⁸⁰.

Far the most systematic ol the opponents of the Aristotelian philo·
sophy in general was Patrizzi or Patricius (b. 1529, d. 1597). His
Discussiones Peripateticae are throughout, sor the most part, a bitter
attaclr on the lile, worlrs, and opinions of Aristotle. Thus, he ire·
quently breaks out in invectives such as this: ‘Quicunque igiturex
Aristotelis dogmatibus philosophatur, is dialectice philosophatur, non
philosophice, non scientifice, non rerum veritatis, sed Aristotelicorum
placitorum est amator ⁸⁰! And, in another place, aster comparing
two contradictory passages from Aristotle, he says: ‘Qua re quid in·
constantius? quid tanti nominis philosopho indignius? Sed licuit
sibi quidquid voluit: et tamen, omnia credita a suis sunt oracula, in
contrariis dogmatibus pennultis srdes par illi habita⁹¹.' His reasons
sor combating the philosophy oi Aristotle are given at length in an
Appendix, entituled ‘Veritatis Studiosis,’ at the end of his ‘Nova de
Universis Philosophia!

Giordano Bruno (b. about 1550, burnt at Rome 1600) was another
of the more prominent opponents ol' Aristotelianism. He wrote a
