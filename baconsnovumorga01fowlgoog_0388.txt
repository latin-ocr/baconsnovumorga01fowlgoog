LJB. II. 12. 365

adhuc lenior videtur ea flamma quae in nonnullis historiis fidis
et gravibus invenitur apparuisse circa capita et comas puero·
rum et virginum⁹⁵ ; quae nullo modo comas adurebat, sed
molliter circum eas trepidabat. Atque certissimum est, circa
equum⁹⁶ in itinere sudantem noctu et suda tempestate appa·
ruisse quandoque coruscationem quandam absque manifesto
calore. Atque paucis abhinc annis, notissimum est et pro

miraculo quasi habitum gremiale cujusdam puellae paulo
motum aut fricatum coruscasse; quod fortasse factumest ob

alumen aut sales quibus gremiale tinctum erat paulo crassius
haerentia et incrustata, et ex fricatione fractae. Atque cer·
tissimum est saccharum omne, sive conditum (ut vocant)
sive simplex, modo sit durius, in tenebris fractum aut cultello
scalptum coruscare⁹⁸. Similiter aqua marina et salsa noctu
interdum invenitur, remis fortiter percussa, coruscarell. Atque

“clemens et lenis,’' is one of the most intensely hot kinds of dame! Bacon

Lambere flamma comas et circum tempora pasci.
Nos pavidi trepidare metu, crinemque flagrantem
Excutere et sanctos restinguere fontibus ignis'

similar stories are told of some of the saints, as, for instance, St. Catberine
of Alexandria and St. Bridget.

⁰⁸ Cp. note on St. Elmo's lire, below.

Μ ‘The girl's apron was probably made of silk, and the “coruscatio ”
electric.’ Mr. Kitchin’s note.

⁸⁸ The crystals of sugat exhibit phosphorescence, when cut or rubbed.

'⁹ This beautiful phenomenon must be familiar to almost every one. The
following extracta (l must apologise for their length) are taken from
Mr. Darwin's Naturalist's Voyage Round the World, ch. 8:

‘While salling a little south of the Plata on one very dark night, the sea
presented a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle. There was a fresh
breeze, and every part of the surface, which during the day is seen as
foam, now glowed witha pale light. The vessel drove before her bows two
