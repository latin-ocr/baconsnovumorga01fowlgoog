lmay give as instances‚ the conceit that the blood-stone is good lot

them that bleed at the nose, with the quaere, whether ‘the stone
taken out of the toad'shead be notos the like virtue, lor the toad
loveth shade and coolness⁸⁸ ;' the ‘report' ol‘the writers ol natural
magic,' quoted apparently with approval, that ‘the heart ol an ape,
worn near the heart, comforteth the heart, and increaseth audacity,'
‘and that the same heart likewise ol arr ape, applied to the neck or
head, helpeth the wit, and is good lor the falling sickness⁸⁸;’ the
statement that ‘there be divers sorts ol bracelets fit to comfort the
spirits, and they be ol three intentione, refrigerant, corroborant, and
aperient ⁶⁷;’ the suggestion to ‘try the soree oi imagination upon
staying the working of beer when the barm is put in, or upon the
¹coming ol butter or cheese,aster the churning, or the renuet be put
in⁶⁸;’ the sections on the influences ol the moon ⁶⁰; the notion that
water is congealed into crystals ⁷⁰. I might, of course, greatly extend
this list, but there is no object in doing so, The reader, who is curious
in such matters, may referto the tenth century, which is lull ol
absurdities ol this kind. On Bacon’s behall, it may be pleaded that
these were the fancies ol his age, lrom which probably no manos that
time was altogether free. We have only to look into books like
Sir Thomas Browne’s ‘Vulgar and Common Errors’ or the various
works ol Joseph Glanville, to see how persistent such notions were
even in the generation alter Bacon's death. lllor'eover, a large
number ol them may be grouped under the heads os ⁸ sympathy and
antipathy,' ‘lorce ol imagination,' tac„ subjecta on which peculiarly
obscure ideas prevailed at this time. Lastly, Bacon's very hopelul-
ness, and his sanguine expectations ol what nature had in store sor
those who diligently studied her, may have rendered him peculiarly
liable to be imposed on by these ‘old wives' lables.'

But lar the most important and,·perhaps at li'rst sight, the least
excusable ol Bacon's scientific errors was his persistent rejection ol
the Copemican theory ⁷¹2 lt seems strange that one who laid claim
to be the great resormer ol science should have steadily relused to

'¹¹ M. Bouillet, in a note on Now. Org. ii. 36,is so much startled with this lact
that he is driven to the supposition that Bacon was deterred lrorn embracing the
Copemican theory by sear ol the inconvenient consequences which might thereby
be entailed on him, ‘surtout sous uu roi aussi de'vot quc Jacques ΙΨ But this
theory appears to me hardly worth discussion. '
