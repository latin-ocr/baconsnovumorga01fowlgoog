Eandem ingreditur viam (priorem scilicet) intellectus sibi

Intellectus sibi permissus, in ingenio sobrio et patiente et
gravi (praesertim si a doctrinis receptis non impediatur),
tentat nonnihil illam alteram viam, quae recta est, sed exiguo
profectu; cum intellectus, nisi regatur et juvetur, res inae·
qualis ²⁴ sit, et omnino inhabilis ad superandam rerum obscuri-

to supply them with sound arguments for it; nor, even in the time of
-Copemicus himself, was it more than the simplest and most consistent
explanation of known facts.

The student is specially recommended to read Mr. Mill's strictures on
this Aphorism. See Mill’s Logic, bk. vi. ch. 5.§ 5. On the other side, he
may refer to Dr. Whewell’s Philosophy of Discovery, ch. xxii. l 56-62.

ln extenuation of liacon’s error, for such 1 conceive it to be, may
be pleaded the exceedingly vague and unsatisfactory character of the
‘axiomata maxime generalia' which were in vogue in his time. As proof
of this, l may cite the list which Mr. Mill himself gives at the beginning
of the a4th chapter of his Examination of Sir W. Hamilton's Philosophy.

Notwithstanding all that is said here and in other places, Bacon himself
has recourse to hypothesis (under the name of ‘permissio intellectus ') in
ll. ao. The view which hethere takes of its relation to inductionis far more
just than that here taken. See my note on the beginning of that Aphorism.

²⁸ The mind is naturally prone to the false method, and is encouraged in
its tendencies by the use of the wilgar logie, which fails to insist on the
examination of first principles. This proueness of the mind to rest in
lirst principles, however obtained, and to resent any examination of them,
is due mainly to a combination of pride with mental indolence. We recoil
from the trouble of reviewing what lies at the bottom of so many of our
beliefs, and we are too proud to acknowledge that we hare been so longor
so frequently in error. To a certain extent, also, it may be accounted for
by the principle of association. We have ourselves repeated, or heard the
maxim repeated by others, so frequently, and in connection withso many
’ other propositions which we accept as true, that we can hardly conceive it
being called in question.
