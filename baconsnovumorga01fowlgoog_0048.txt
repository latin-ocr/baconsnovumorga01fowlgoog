the progress ol Mechanics‚ he makes no mention either os Archimedes
himself, oroi Stevinus, Galileo, Guldinus, or Ghetaldus⁴². He makes
no allusion to me theory oi Eouilibrium ⁴⁸. He observes that a ball
osone pound weight will fall nearly as fast through the air as a ball
ol two, without alluding to the theory of the acceleration of falling
bodies, which had been made known by Galileo more than thirty
years belore ⁴⁹. He proposes an enquiry with regard to the lever,-
namely, whether in a balance with arms of different length but equal
weight the distance from the lulcmm has any effect upon the in·
clination-though the theory ol the lever was as well understood in
his own time as it is now ⁵⁰. In making an experiment ol his own
to ascertain the cause ol the motion ol a windmill, he overlooks au
obvious circumstance which makes the experiment inconclusive‚ and
an equally obvious variation ol the same experiment which would
have shown him that his theory was lalse ⁶¹. He speaks of the poles
of the earth as fixed, in a manner which seems to imply that he was
not acquainted with the precession ol the equinoxes³¹; and in another
place oi the north pole being above, and the south pole below, asa
reason why in our hemisphere the north winds predominate over the

south ⁶³!

tive Sciences, bk. ii. ch. r, audior those ol Galileo and Stevinus, bk. vi. chs. 1, a. 1

or even in the Biographie Universelle, see Mr. Ellis's Preiace to the Historia Densi et
Rari, pp. aro-232, and Montucla, ed. ol ¹799· dte, ii. 5. The work ol Guldinus,
De Motu Terrae, &c., was not published till 1622, and his more celebrated work,
Centrobarytica, dte, not till 1635. Hence, Bacon may surely, in this case, be ex·
ctued ior his ignorance. For an account ol Guldinus and his discoveries, see Mon-
tucia, ii. 3¹·3⁶·]

Archimedes, and, therefore, Bacon's silence is the more remarkable]

Pisa between 1589-1592. lt is only iair, however, to Bacon to add that, though
these experimenta were known to many scientific men, Galileo did not publish any
account ot' them till the appearance oi his Dialogues in ιδῃ]
