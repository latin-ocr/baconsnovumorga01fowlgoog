Amongst the various causes which have been assigned sor Aris-
totle’s comparative lailure in this branch ol his philosophy arethe
neglect of facts (or, as it has been otherwise phrased, his disregard oi
experience), a partiality lor abstract reasoning, a want ‘oi distinctness
and os appropriateness to the facts in the Ideas he employs, and the
absence oi verification. Of the first, it may be shewn (as has been
abundantly done by Dr. Whewell in his History of the Inductive
Sciences and by Mr. G. H. Lewes in his work on Aristotle, and as
will be obvious to any one acquainted with Aristotle's physical
treatises), that it is very inaccurately stated. Aristotle, especially ln
his History of Animals, has collected every large number oi facts,
though the laets may not always be well selected or precisely de·
scribed. As to the second charge, not only does it err in vagueness,
but it may be met with a plea of justification. ‘Abstract reasoning‚'
provided it be properly conducted, is quite as essential a iactor oi
science‚ as is the accumulation of facta. The third charge (which is
that advanced by Dr. Whewell ⁶⁸) is certainly well-grounded, but it
specifies, as it appears to me, only one ol many causes, while it leaves
unanswered the question, ‘Why are Aristotle’s ideas inappropriate to
his facts? ¹, one oi the very problems to be solved. Nor does it seem
to me that the fourth cause (which is that assigned by lllr. Lewes in
his work on Aristotle) supplies an adequate explanation. For what
is Verification? It is the continuation oi one mode of prooi by
another, as, for instance, ol induction by deduction‚ or of deduction
by induction. But, though Aristotle's reasoning is undoubtedly often

rejection of Final Causea. which possesses much value or discrimination, is to be
found in Dugald Stewart's Elements, part ii. subdivision 1. ch. 4. sect. 6 (Ed.
Hamilton, Works, vol. iii. pp. 555—357). Much oi what Stewart says would now
require to be recast. in view ol the facts and theory oi Evolutiou. But the
student will still find his remarks oi considerable interest.
