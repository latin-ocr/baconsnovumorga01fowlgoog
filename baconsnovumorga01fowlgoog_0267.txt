atque illorum concursu ⁴⁴, ad constituenda corpora naturalia
Rursus,quum homo naturae libertatem contemplatur, incidit
in species rerum, animalium, plantarum, mineralium3 unde
facile in eam labitur cogitationem, ut existimet esse in natura
quasdam formas rerum primarias, quas natura educere
molitur: atque reliquam varietatem ex impedimentis et aber·
rationibus naturae in opere suo conficiendo, aut ex diversarum
specierum conflictu, et transplantatione alterius in alteram,
provenire⁴⁶. Atque prima cogitatio qualitates primas ele·
mentares⁴t secunda proprietates occultas et virtutes spe-
cificas⁴⁷ nobis peperit3 quarum utraque pertinet ad inania

elements themselves, are composed the various natural bodies, as we
actually lind them.

Bouillet notices that, in the Thema Coeli (E. and S, vol. iii. p· 777),
hardness and softness are counted amongst the ‘elementary qualities!

⁴⁴ We must obviously read either concursus, or deque instead of atque.

‘⁸ This is an excellent statement of the hypothesis by which the Realists
attempted to account at once for the permanente and variety in the forms
of animal and vegetable life. ’The ‘ primary forms’ or types were, ac·
cording to the strictest and most consistent school of Realists, supposed to
have existed prior to any of the individual objects in which they are
embodied. These types ‘natura educere molitur!

lt is, perhaps, superfluous to remark that, since the publication' of ΜΓ.
Darwin's work on the ‘Origin of Species,’ the questions glanced at in ·
this paragraph have assumed, even amongst those who do not accept
Mr. Darwin's hypotheses, an altogether different form and received au
altogether different solution from that which was formerly current.

⁴⁰ See last note hutone. All the remaining qualities of bodies were
called secondary. This distinction is, of course, quite different from that
of the primary and secondary qualities of bodies, as stated by Descartes,
Locke, and subsequent writers. See Hamiltongri Reid, pp. 836-7.
. ‘⁷ Cp. Newton's Optics, bk. iii. (Works, Ed. Horsley, vol. iv. p. 2⁶1),
where, speaking of the Principles of Motion, he says: ‘And the Aristo·
telians gave the name of Occult qualities not to manifest qualities, but
to such qualities only as they supposed to lie hid in bodies, and to be
the unknown causes of manifest effecta: such as would be the causes
of gravity, and of Magnetic and Electric attractions, and of fermentations,
if we should suppose that these forces, or actions, arose from qualities
unknown to us, and incapable of being discovered and made manifest.
Such Occult qualities put a stop to the improvement of Natural Philosophy,
and therefore of late years have been rejected. To tell us, that every
'species of things is endowed with an occult specific quality, by which it
acts and produces manifest effects, is to tell us nothing: but to derive
two or three general principles of motion from phaenomena. and afterwards
to tell us how the properties and actions of all corporeal things follow
