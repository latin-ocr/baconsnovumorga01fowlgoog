is a passage bearing on the connection between Bacon's designs ‘and
the establishment 01 the Royal Society: ‘And let me say to you,
that il you give these things in charge amongst your acquaintance,
that each man in his way may add to the search 01 others, then you
do sully prosecute the Verulamian desigu; then our labour is joined
and collegiate, and not always running in the narrowness 01 single
endeavours' Maclaurin, again, in his Account 01 Newton's Philo·
sophical Discoveries (p. 61) says: ‘It has been observed that
Mr. Boyle was bom the same year that Lord Bacon died, as it he
had been destin’d to carry on his plan!

I come next to Dr. Robert Hooke (b. 1635, d. 1703), who suc·
ceeded Oldenburg as Secretary of the Royal Society, and was
amongst the most distinguished 01 its early members. Amongst his
Posthumorrs Works is published one entitled The Present State 01
Natural Philosophy aod the Method 01 Improving it, which is
described hy Dr. Whewell as an ‘attempt to adapt the Novum
Organum to the age which succeeded its publication.' The whole
01 this treatise is in the lines 01 the Novum Organum, and much 01 it
is a mere translation 01 its language. And yet Hoolre seldom men·
tions Bacon, another prool out 01 many how little the writers 01 that
time think it necessary to cite by name the authors from whom they
borrow 01 to whom they are under obligations. ln one place, how·
ever (Posthumous Worlrs, p. ό), he announces his design as follows:
‘Some other course therefore must be taken to promote the Search 01
Knowledge. Some other kind 01 Art 101 Enquiry than what hath
hitherto been made use 01, must be discovered; the Intellect is not to
be suffered to act without its Helps‚ but is continually to be assisted
by some Method or Engine, which shall be as a Guide to regulare its
Actions, so as that it shall not be able to act amiss: 01 this Engine,
no Man except the incomparable Verulam hath had any thoughts,
and he indeed hath promoted it to a very good pitch; but there is

yet somewhat more to be added, which he seemed to want time to
compleat' Hooke's work, like its prototype, was uniinished.
Testimonies 01 this kind might easily be multiplied to almost any
extent. Such are those 01 John Evelym, an early member 01 the
Royal Society, and celebrated as the author 01 Sylva, Numrsmatav,
the well-known Diary, &c.; 01 Dr. Joshua Childrey, who, in a letter to

’¹ There are constant allusions to Bacon iu both these works, especially in the
formem see particularly Numismata, cb. 9. p. 34o; Sylva, Address to the Reader
(much eslarged in the 3rd Edition).
