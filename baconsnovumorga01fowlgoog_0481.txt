Earum ratio talis est. Cum in inquisitione naturae alicujus
intellectus ponitur tanquam in aequilibrio, ut incertus sit utri
naturarum e duabus, vel quandoque pluribus causa naturae
inquisitae attribui aut assignari debeat, propter complurium
naturarum concursum frequentem et ordinarium ⁷⁰, instantiae

, ινκιίε ostendunt consortium unius ex naturis (quoad naturam

inquisitam) fidum et indissolubile, alterius autem varium et
separabile ; unde terminatur quaestio, et recipitur natura illa
prior pro causa, missa altera et repudiata. Itaque hujusmodi
instantiae sunt maximae lucis, et quasi magnae authoritatis ;

to be instituted for the purpose on the Puy de dee‚ a high mountain
in Auvergne, while it convinced every one of the truth of Torricelli's
views, tended more powerfully than any thing which had previously been
done in science to confirm, in the rninds of men, that disposition to ex·

perimental verification which had scarcely yet taken full and secure root.⁸
Discourse, dcc, § 246.

Dr. Hippus draws a very useful distinction between tests or experimenta
crucis which are decisire both ways and those which are what be calls
unilateral:

‘Thus, if a flante burns in any gas submitted to experiment, we may
roughly (though only roughly) conclude that such gas contains orygem
but, if the dame is extinguished, we cannot, therefore, conclude that the
gas contains no oxygen, for the oxygen present may be iu too close combi-
nation with some other substance, to enable it to support combustion. But
a perfect test would be weighing any gas; for if it be heavier than common
air, in the ratio of ¹·435 to m, it is oxygen; if lighter or heavier it is not.
Thus, too, in discussing whether a given writing be innocent or libellous,
that is, maliciously composed‚ or composed with any improper motive of
any lind, the truth isa unilateral test; for if the allegations be false, there
must be malice3 but there may be malice also, though the matter stated
be true. There would arise very great distinctness in argumentation, were
we to adopt this convenient phrase of a complete and an incomplete or
uuilateral test-many of the errors in reasoning, especially upon moral
subjects, arising from mistaking incomplete for complete tests.¹ Account,

the phraseology of the first sentence.

⁷⁰ ln other words, an account of the difficulty of disentangling from the

mass of antecedents the one which stands in the relation of cause to the
given effect.
