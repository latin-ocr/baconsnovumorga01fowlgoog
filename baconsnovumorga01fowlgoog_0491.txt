rotaverit cum consensu manifesto (licet admodum irregula-
riter) motus diurni, sed potius rotaverit in contrarium coeli³²;
tum certe hucusque judicandum est posse esse in natura
aliquem talem motum. Sin nihil hujusmodi inveniatur,
habendus est pro suspecto, et ad alias instantias crucis eirca
hoc confugiendum.

(3) Similiter, sit natura inquisita Pondus sive Gravess.
Bivium circa hanc naturam tale est. Necesse est ut gravia
et ponderosa vel tendant ex natura sua ad centrum terrae,
per proprium schematismum; vel ut a massa corporea ipsius
terrae, tanquam a congregatione corporum connaturalium,
attrahantur et rapiantur, et adeam per consensum serantur.
At posterius hoc si in causa sit, sequitur ut quo propius gravia
appropinquant ad terram, eo lortius et majore cum impetu
serantur ad eam; quo longius ab ea absint, debilius et tardius
(ut fit in attractionibus magneticis); idque fieri intra spatium

¹¹ Whereas the planets and their satellites, with the sole known excep-
tion οἱ the satellites of Uranus, revolve with what· is called a direct motion,
that is, from W. to E, the comets seem to be almost equally divided
between those which have a direct motion, from W. to E„ and those which
have a retrograde motion, from E. to W. But what Bacou desiderated was
a comet whose proper motion from W. to E. more than compensated ior
the apparent diurnal motion oi the heavens from E. to W., so that it might
visibly move in the opposite direction to the heavens. This,it appears,
would have convinced him that there is a motion of rotation from W.
to E, and that this motion, which he regarded as leigned simply t'or the
purpose of facilitating the calculatione of astronomers (‘res conficta et
supposita: Μ), is not merely a modification ol the diurnal motion. tf no
such instance can be found, then, he says, we must continue to aspect
the theory, till we cau find some other crucial instance to settle tlte
question.

⁸⁸ This paragraph does great credit to Bacon’s sagacity, and isone os
those which gire him a claim to be regarded as a pioneer of science as well
as a reformet of method. ‘Voltaire,’ says Mr. Ellis, ‘cites the passage iu
the text in support of his remark that “ le plus grand service, peut-itte, que
F. Bacou ait reudu a ia philosophie a ete de deviner l'attraction.” But in
reality the notion of attraction in oue form or other (e. g. the atti-action oi
the sea by the moon) sprang up in the iniancy of physical speculation; and
it cannot be affirmed that Bacon's ideas on the subject were as clear as those
oi his predecessor William Gilbert.’ This criticism, 1 think, does Baeon
scant justice. Even ii the idea was suggested to him hythe work ofGilbert,
he ought, at least, to have the credit of having detached the conception oi
attraction lrom that oi magnetism. Cp, however, p. 479, n. 25.
