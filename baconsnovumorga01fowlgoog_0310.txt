philosophia recepta sunt, comprehenduntur; sed nova, licet in
melius mutata, tanturn non summoventur et exterminantur ⁶⁵.

Denique invenias, ex quorundam theologorum imperitia,
aditumalicui philosophiae, quamvis emendatae, pene inter·
clusum esse. Alii siquidem simplicius subverentur, ne sorte
altior in naturam inquisitio ultra concessum sobrietatis tenni-
num penetret3 traducentes et perperam torquentes ea, quae
de divinis mysteriis in Scripturis sacris adversus rimantes
secreta divina dicuntur, ad occulta naturae, quae nullo inter·
dicto prolubentur. Alii callidius conjiciunt et animo versant,
si media ignorentur, singula ad manum et virgulam divinam
(quod religionis, ut putant, maxime intersit) facilius posse
referri : quod nihil aliud est, quam Deo per mendacium grati·
ficari⁵⁶ velle. Alii ab exemplo metuunt, ne motus et muta·
tiones circa philosophiam in religionem incurrant ac desinant.

⁸⁸ This is one of Bacon’sshrewdest remarks. 11 is abundantly illustrated
in the history ο1 science both before and since his time. A new discovery
in science is at first decried as contrary or even fatal 1ο laith; then,
alter a time, it is grudgingly admitted, and incorporated into the received
doctrine, till at last no one dreams of calling it in question. But the
process soon begins afresh with some more recent discovery, so that a
constant warfare is going on between the unwise theologian and the
scientific investigator. And this warfare is wholly unnecessary, and can
have only one issue. For the scientific theory must ultimately stand or
fall on scientific grounds, and, should it be ultimately admitted, the
theologiau, whether he acquiesces in the result or not, must, with the rest
of mankind, bow to the decision of competent judges. No thoughtful
man, of course, can avoid comparing the results ο1 science with his
religious beliels, but the results of seience, to be worth anything at all,
mrtst be arrived at by a purely independent process, employing only
scientific data and submitting only to scientific tests. The man of science
has a right to demand tbat his investigations shall not be hampered by
theologieal prepossessious3 but the results at which he arrives become
the common property of all, and it is lor the theologian to coordinata
these results with his religious beliefs, or, il need be, to adapt his religious
beliels to the new laets or newly established generalisations which are
presented to him.

⁸⁶ Cp. De Augmentis, lib. i. (E. and S., vol. i. p. 436): ‘Namque eos
qui autumant nimiam scientiam inclinare mentem in atheismum, igno-
rantiamque secundarum carrsarurn pietati erga primam obstetricari libenter
coenpellarem Jobi quaestione, Aa oportem meatui pro Deo, et ejus gratia
dotum loqui emaculat, ut ipsi gratylcmurl' The passage in Job, here
referred to, is cb. xiii. ver. 7.
