⁹⁹ These remarks are highly philosophical. We ought never to rest
till exceptione are explained, and, when explained, they will usually be
found to fall under some general law of nature, or, in the case of moral
and social phenomena, to be what Mr. Tylor has happily called ‘ survivals·
of some state of things which was far more general in the past. The
history of lnnguage, it may be noticed, is peculiarly n'ch in phenomena of
this kind.

Sir John Herschel illustrates this instance as follows: ‘The discovery of
the magnetism of nichel, which, though inferior to that of iron, is still con·
siderable3 that of cobalt, yet feebler, and that of titanium, which is only
barely perceptible, have effectually broken down the imaginary limit
between iron and the other materials of the world, and established the
existence of that general law of continuity which it is one chief business of
philosophy to trace throughout nature. The more recent discoveries of
M. Arago have completed this generalisation, hy showing that there is
no substance but which, under proper circumstances, is capable of
exhibiting unequivocal signs of magnetic virtue. And to obliterate all
traces of that line of separation which was once so broad, we are now
enabled, by the great discovery of Oersted, to communicate at and during
pleasure to a coiled wire of any metat indifferently all the properties of
a magnet3-its attraction, repulsion, and polarity3 and that even in a
more intense degree than was previously thought to be possible in the
best natural magnets.' Discourse‚ dec, § 3⁶4· Appended to the later
editions of Sir W. R. Grove's Correlation of Physical Forces is an
admirable Address‚ delivered before the British Association, on the Lavv of
Continuity.
