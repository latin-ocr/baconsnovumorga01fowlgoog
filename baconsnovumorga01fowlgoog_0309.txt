286 NOVUM ORGANUM.

Quinetiam, ut nunc sunt res, conditio sermonum de natura
sacta est durior et magis curn periculo, propter theologorum
scholasticorum summas et methodos; qui cum theologiam
(satis pro potestate) in ordinem redegerint, et in artis formam
effinxerint, hoc insuper effecerunt, ut pugnax et spinosa
Aristotelis philosophia ⁶⁴ corpori religionis, plus quam par
erat, immisceretur.

Eodem etiam spectant (licet diverso modo) eorum com·

ex authoritatibus philosophorum deducere et confirmare haud

varietate animos hominum permulcentes; sed interim divina

there were antipodes! and is not pope Nicholas deserted by his own party
for correcting the sermons oi Berengarius, and making him recant into
a worse errori and posterity will certainly make themselves very merry
with the wise sentences made lately at Rome against Galileo and the
Jansenists. To condemn one truth is more shameful than to broacb two
errors: for he that in an honest and diligent enquiry misses something ol
the mark, will have the apologias of human infirmity, and the praise of
doing his best; but he that condemns a truth when it is told him, is
an envious fool, and is a murderer of bis brother’s fame, and bis brother's
reason’

Mr. Mill discusses the incapacity of conceiving the existence of Antipodes
in two places of his Logic, namely, blr. ii. cb. 5. § ⁶, and blr. v. cb. 3.
§ 3. lt is, perhaps, superfluous to remark, with reference to these
passages, that Mr. Mill's riews as to the relation of inconceivability to
impossibility are combated by ΜΓ. Herbert spencer.

⁸⁴ ln the correspondiug passage of the Cogitata et Visa (E. and S,
p. 596),be says: ‘hoc insuper ausi sunt, ut contentiosam et tumultu·
ariam Aristotelis philosophiam corpori religionis insemerint!

lt has often been remarked that the distinguishing characteristic of the
scholastic theology was the union of theological matter with a dialectical
form, the theological matter being derived from the Scripturas and the
Fatbers, and the dialectical form from the Logic of Aristotle. But witb
the form, no inconsiderable portion of the matter of the Aristotelian
philosophy, especially in the domains of psycbology and metaphysica
frequently affected an entrance, and thus, to a certain extent, determinet!
both the terminology and the doctrines oi the Mediaeval Church. ln
illustration of this statement, see Bishop Hampden’s nampton Lectores

a work which well deserves the attention both of tbe theological and
the philosophical student.
