reprinted more than once in the interval ⁴³. He complained that no
considerable advance had been made in Geometry beyond Euclid,
without taking any notice of what had been done by Archimedes and
Apollonius ¹⁴. He saw the importance of detemrining accurately the
specific gravities of different substances, and himself attempted to
form a table of them by a rude process of his own, without knowing
of the more scientific though still imperfect methods previously
employed by Archimedes, Ghetaldus, and Porta⁴⁶. He speaks of
the εὕρηκα of Archimedes in a manner which implies that he did not
clearly apprehend either the nature of the problem to be solved or
the principles upon which the solution depended⁴⁸. In reviewing

ss See vol. i. p. 577, note a. [De Augm. iii. 6. ‘In Arithmeticis autem, nec
satis varia et commoda inventa sunt supputationum compendia praesertim circa
Progressiones. quarum in Physicis usus estnon mediocris.' On this hir. Ellis
observes in his note: ‘One would certainly not infer from this remark, to which
there is nothing corresponding in the Advancement of Learning. that Bacon was
aware thatin the interval which had elapsed since its publication, the greatest of
all inventione for facilitating arithmetical computatione bad been made known.
Napier's Logaritbms were published in 1614, and repn'nted on the continent in
1620; in which year Gunter's Canon of Triangles was also publimed. 1111618
Robert Napier's account of his father's method and Briggs's first table of Logaritbrns
were both published. In the year succeedng that of the publication of the De
Augmentis his larger tables. and probably those of Wingate, made their appearance!

‘'I'bese dates are sufficient to show how much the attention ofmathematicians was
given to the subject. lt would almost seem as if some one. possibly Savile. bad
told Bacon-wbat was no doubt true-that the application of the doctrine of series
to arithmetical computation was not as yet brought to perfectiora. and that he had
adopted the remark without understanding the importance oi the discovery to
which it referred, and perhaps without being aware that any such discovery had
been made'

Imay add thal an English translation of Napier's Logarithms by Edward Wright
was published at London in 1616, aud republisbed in rora]

medes Promotus of Marinus Gbetaldus was published at Rome in 1603. His
method of finding specific gravities has, as Mr. Ellis remarks (vol. li. p. ²3⁰)›
remained in use, with certain modifications aud corrections to the present day.
'f he first complete edition of Baptista Poeta's Natural Magio was published at Naples
in 1589. Many of the ‘experimenta' in Bacon's Sylva Sylvarum are said by Mr. Ellis
to be taken from this work. Bucen, therefore, probably became acquainted with
it between writing the Historia Densi et Rari and tbe Sylva sylvarum]
