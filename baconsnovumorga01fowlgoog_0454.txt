Verum his missis, etiam in ipsa configuratione mundi in
majoribus non sunt negligendae instantiae conformes,· veluti
Africa, et regio Peruviana cum continente se porrigente usque
ad Fretum Magellanicum. Utraque enim regio habet similes
isthmos et similia promontoria, quod non temere accidit ⁹¹.

Item Novus et Vetus Orbis; in eo quod utrique orbes
versus septentriones lati sunt et exporrecti, versus austrum
autem angusti et acuminati ⁹².

Item instantiae conformes nobilissimae sunt frigora intensa
in media (quam vocant) ae'ris regione, et ignes acerrimi qui
saepe reperiuntur erumpentes ex locis subterraneis3 quae
duae res sunt ultimitates et extrema3 naturae scilicet fri·
gidi versus ambitum coeli, et naturae calidi versus viscera

⁹¹ Bacon seems to be comparing the western or corresponding sides of the
two continents. The conformity of the opposite sides is also remarkable,
the projections on one side answering roughly to the recesses on the
other.

⁹² Humboldt discusses these and similar phenomena at some length.
See Col. Sabine's Translation of the Kosmos, vol. i. p. 280, dte. While
acknowiedging that ‘little can be ascertained by investigation respecting
the causai connection of the great phenomena appertaining to the forma·
tion of our continents, and to the analogias and contrusis presented by
their configuration,' he suggests two principal causes, acting in succession,
which may have determined such configuration. ‘Slight disturbances in
the equilibrium of the elastic forces in the interior of our planet may
have determined their action more towards the northern than the southern
hemisphere, and hare occasioned the elevation of the dry land in the
eastern hemisphere in the form of a wide connected mass, having its major
axis almost parallel to the equator,—and in the western and more oceanic
hemisphere, in a comparatively narrow band, following the direction of the
meridien? Again, ‘Our Atlantic Ocean presents the characteristics ofa
valley. lt is as ii the fiow of the waters had been directed first towards
the north-east, then towards the north-west, and then again towards the
north-east· The parallelism of the coasts north of 10⁰ of South latitude,
the projecting and re·entering angles the convexity of Brazil opposite
to the Gulfof Guinea, and the convexity of Africa to the Gulf of Mexico,
ali favour this view, which at first may seem too hasardous. ln the
Atlantic Valley, as is indeed usually the case in the form of large masses of
land, coasts deepiy indented and fringed with many islands are placed
opposite to those of a contrary character!
