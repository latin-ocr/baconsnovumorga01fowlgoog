LIB. II. 3¹8. 481

naturalis, emanans a corpore, subsistere possit aliquo tempore
et aliquo loco omnino sine corpore; prope est ut possit etiam
emanare in origine sua a substantia incorporea. Videtur enim
non minus requiri natura corporea ad actionem naturalem
sustentandam et devehendam‚ quam ad excitandam aut gene-

randam.
XXXVIII.

Sequuntur quinque ordines instantiarum, quas uno voca-
bulo generali Instantias Lampadis²l sive Inforrnatiom's Primae
appellare consuevimus. Eae sunt quae auxiliantur sensui.
Cum enim omnis interpretatio naturae incipiat a sensu ³⁰, atque
a sensuum perceptionibus recta, constanti, et munita via ducat
ad perceptiones intellectus, quae sunt notiones verae et axio·
mata, necesse est ut, quanto magis copiosae et exactae
fuerint repraesentationes sive praebitioncs ipsius sensus, tanto
omnia cedant facilius et foelicius.

Harum autem quinque instantiarum lampadas, primae ro·
borant, ampliant, et rectificant actiones sensus immediatas3

but lmpulse of Body can move body3 and yet that is not a reason sufii-
cient to make us deny it possible, against the constant experience we have
of it in ourselves in ali our voluntary motions, which are produced in us
only by the free action or Thought of our own minds, and are not nor can
be the elfects of impulse or Determination of the motion of blind matter
in or upon our bodies rrrrr Tis an over-valuing ourselves to reduce all to
the narrow measure of our capacities3 and to conclude all things impos-
sible to hedone, whose manner of doing exceeds our comprehension.
This is to make our Comprehension infinite or God finite, when what he
cando is limited to what we can conceive of it.’ ln bk. ii. ch. 23.§ 32,
and elsewhere, he maintains that it is ‘no more a contradiction, that
Thinking should exist separate and independent from Solidity‚ than it is
acontradiction, that Solidity should exist separate and independent from
Thinking a s a and, having as clear and distinct ideas in us of Thinking as
of Solidity‚ l know not why we may not as well allow a thinking thing
without Solidity‚ i. e. immaterial, to exist, as a solid thing without Think-
ing, i. e. matter, to exist.¹ Hobbes, on the other hand, regarded the expres-
sions ‘incorporeal spirit,’ ‘incorporeal substance‚’ δῖα, as contradictions
in terms, and seems to hare thought that they had no meaning, even when
applied to God. See Leviathan, Parti. ch. 12, Part iii. ch. 34, and other
places.

²⁰ The ‘Instances' thus far described have for their office to assist the
Understanding; the next five, called generically ‘ lastances of the Lamp,'
serve to inform or supply the defects of the Senses.
