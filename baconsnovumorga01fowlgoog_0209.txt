opposition to the ‘pars inforrnans,' which was to be comprised in the
remaining books. The following brief account of its contenis may be
of service to the reader. Aphs. 1-31 consist of certain preliminary remarks,
chiefly on the futility of the metlrods of enquiry at present in use and
the necessity of a more faithful study of Nature. ln Apias. 32-37‚ he
makes a kind of apology for the introduction of a new method. hphs.

the utmost importance. ‘Primo enim mentis area aequanda, et liberanda
ab eis quae hactenus recepta sunt! (Partis Secundae Delineatio, Ellis
and Spedding, vol. iii. p. 548.) Then follow the signs, five in number, of
the weakness and inutility of preceding philosophice (Aphs. 71-77). These
are followed by the causes, fifteen in number, of so long continuance
