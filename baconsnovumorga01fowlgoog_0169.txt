The first attempt at editing the complete works oi Bacon was made
by J. B. Schbnwetter and J. Gruter, in their edition in Latin, issued

at Frankfort on the Main in 1665 ⁶⁸. The Latin Works were published
by Wettstein at Amsterdam in 1684, and reprinted in 1695 and 1730.
There was an edition of the Opera Omnia ‘opera Simonis johannis
Amoldi' at Leipsic in 1694. An edition in 4 vols. was issued by
J. Blackboume at London, in 1730. There was a handsome Edition‚

with a lise by Mallet, issued in 1740, and this was followed with ·

tolerable rapidity by several others. Finally‚ we have Basil Montagu’s
edition, Pickering, 1825-1836, and the truly valuable and splen·
did edition of Ellis, Spedding, and Heath, Longmans, 1857, bc..
Bouillet’s Edition oi the Philosophical Works will be noticed below.

The following are the principal works on Bacon's philosophy in

η general or the Novum Organum in particular, which have fallen

under my notice. I omit merely popular lectures, or chapters in
Histories of Philosophy, some 'oi the latter oi which, however, such,
sor instance, as those oi Brucker, Lewes, Ueberweg, ac, are of con·
siderable merit. On the other hand, 1 insert short notices of the
Baconian Philosophy, which would otherwise be likely to escape the
reader’s attention.

Voltaire. Lettres sur les Anglois. Lettre XII. About 1728.
This is reproduced, with additions, in the Dictionnaire Philosophique.

Encyclopedie began to appear in 1751. Discours Preliminaire,
pp. 24, 25, and Article on Bacon.

Analyse de la Philosophie du Chancellier Franpois Bacon, avec sa
vie, &c par A. Deleyre. Amsterdam and Paris, 1755 3 Leyden, 1756.
Only a small portion os this work refers to the Baconian philosophy
properly so called, hut in the Preface to the work Le Christianisme
&c., noticed below, the author says that Bacou is hardly known to the
majority of men oi letters in France, except through this Analysis oi
his Philosophy. The book was published anonymously.

⁸⁸ Bouillet speaks oia collection oi the Latin works oi Bacon, edited byRavvley,
which appeared at Amsterdam in 6 vols. in 1663. lt is difficolt to suppose that he
is altogether mistaken,bnt1 can find no other mention ol this edition, though
1 have made diligent search both in books and catalogues.
