are not infrequently marked with a grandeur and solemnity of tone,
a majesty of diction, which renders it impossible to lorget, and
difficolt even to criticise them. He speaks as one having authority,
and itis impossible toresist the magic of his voice. Whenever he
wishes to be emphatic, there is the true ring oi genius about ali that
he says. Hence, perhaps, it is that there is no author, unless it he
Shakspeare, who is so easily remembered or so frequently quoted.
His phraseology, when most quaint, as in the case of the ‘Idols' and
the ‘Instances,' is often most attractive to the reader and most per-
sistent in its hold on the memory. Hence, too, perhaps, it is that
there is no author so stimulating. Bacon might well be called the
British Socrates. Even had his individual precepts been utterly
worthless, many men must have owed their first impulse to the
study of nature, or to independent investigation in general, to the
terse and buming words, issuing‚ as it were, srom the lips oi an
irresistible commander, with which he urges them to the work.

Such, I conceive, are the principal modes and directions in which
the infiuence oi Bacon was exercised. It would be easy to add to
these, but they will readily suggest others, and the limits of this
work necessarily compel me to aim at brevity rather than ex·
panston.

This subject has already, to a great extent, been discussed in the
latter part ol the last section, and it will be unnecessary here to add
much to what has there been said. The two questions, however,
oi Bacon's influence during the past, and the value oi his works to
the student at the present time, seem to be so distinctas to require
separate treatment, however much they may run into each other.

The intrinsic value oi Bacon’s logical works to the student at the
present time, apart irom their historical interest, as having, to adopt
the fine saying of Macaulay, ‘moved the intellects which have moved
the world,' may be briefly considered under two aspects. The first
oi these is their general effect in guarding, stimulating, and disciplining
the intellect; the second is the amount oi definite logical doctrine,
comprised in them, which retains any permanent value.

With regard to the first point, 1 know no work os the same kind
so stimulating to a young reader, or so likely to ioster habits oi
