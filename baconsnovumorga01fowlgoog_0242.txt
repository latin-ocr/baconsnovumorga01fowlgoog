ΗΒ. Ι. 48. 219

Neque rursus cogitari potest quomodo aeternitas defluxerit
ad hunc diem3 cum distinctio illa, quae recipi consuevit, quod
sit infinitum aparte ante, et a parte post, nullo modo constare
possit3 quia inde sequeretur, quod sit unum infinitum alio
infinito majus, atque ut consumatur infinitum, et vergat ad
finitum⁷2. Similis est subtilitasde lineis semper divisibilibus,

hgain, though we are as little able to picture to our minds the process of
inlinitesirnal subdivision as that of infinite addition, we are compelled by
considerations, similar to those which we have already gone through, to
affirm the infinite divisibility of both lines and matter. A line, however
small, must have two ends, and so be capable of bisection; an atom must
hare an upper andan under side, and so be capable of division.

The questions on which l have so brielly touched, and the very concep·
tion of infinity itself, have been the occasion of much controversy. The
student, who wishes to acquaint himself with the main outlines of these
discussions, will do well to read the chapter on ‘ lnlinity' in Locke’s
Essay (bl.ii.ch.17); Kant’s Kritilr der Reinen Vemunft, Transcenden·
tale Dialektik, bk. ii. ch. a (Die Antinomie der Reinen vernunst), where
the antinomies or contradictions connected with Cause and God are
discussed, as well as those connected with Space, Time, and Matter3
Sir W. Hamiltou's Lectures on Metaphysics, Lecture 383 lllr. Mill’s
Examination oi Hamilton, ch. 63 and, lastly, as a defence oi Sir W.
Hamilton and a reply to Mr. Mill, Dr. Mansel’s ‘Philosophy of the Con·
ditioned.' The student of Kant will derive great assistance from consulting,
on this subject, the recent work of ΜΓ. Caird on ‘The Philosophy of
Kant,' pt. ii. chs. 16, 17. lt must be recollected, however, that Mr. Caird’s
criticisms oi Kant, and the extensions which he endeavours to give to his
philosophy, are made entirely from the Hegelian stand-point. Much of
the difficulty and confusion experienced in dealing with these questions
would be avoided, ii the student could keep clearly before his mind the
fact that the term ‘infinite' simply expresses the negation oi ‘finite’
For ‘that alone,' says Loclre, ‘is infinite, which has no bounds ; and that
the Idea of lnfinity, in which our thoughts can find none! And again,
that is an infinite space or number ‘which in a constant and endless
inlarging and progressior, the mind can in thought never attain to.’
Essay, bk. ii. ch. 17.§8.

υ Bacon’s criticism is unfortunate and could only arise from bis
ignorance of mathematics. ln reasoning on ‘infinities,’ it is a first
principle that the addition or subtraction oi any finite quantity, however
large, may‚'in comparison with inlinity,be neglected. ocssrn²¹ oc. This
formula is entirely independent of the value which we assign to a, pro·

With regard to the distinction between inanium a parre ante and in·
finium a parte post, it seems to me that it is not only perfectly legi·
timate, but that it suggests the only way in which the mind can attempt
to picture to itself either inlinity of time or infinity of space. We
