for example, that it has only one bone in its neck, but no cervical
vertebrae (Hist. An. ii. 1 (3)), the story that the hen-partridge
is impregnated by hearing the voice or smelling the breath of the
male bird (De Gen. Anim. iii. 1 (26, trel), and the statement,
adopted probably from Herodotus, that the crocodile moves its upper
jaw (Hist. An. i. 11 (ιο) and iii. 7 (4) ). For additional instances, see
the Article in the Quarterly Review, above referred to. Sometimes, as
in the case of the cranium of the dog, which he supposes to conslst oi
a single bone (Hist An. iii. 7 (3)), it is difficult to say whether the mis-
take is due to defective observation or to the unsuspecting reception
of a popular belief, or, lastly, to over-hasty generalisation.

(4) The fault just noticed was also undoubtedly the cause of many
of Aristotle's errore. Though, perhaps, he was not without the con-
ception of scientific induction⁵⁹‚ yet the form of induction which he
usually employs is that of Simple Enumeration. And, as the enume-
ration of instances must, in most cases, necessarily be scanty, he
naturally lapsed into the habit of generalising on insufficient data.
The selectr'on of instances as distinct from their enumeration (the point
on which Baeon so constantly and emphatically insists) would, doubt·
less, have done much to transform the philosophy of the time, and to
accelerate the progress of science. But it is precisely this difference
which distinguishes modern from ancient induction. As I have else-
where (see Inductive Logic, grd Ed, pp. 275, ac.) spoken at some
length on this defert in Aristotle's method, 1 shall not dwell on it in
this place. It may be described, from different points of view, either
as hasty generalisation, or as 'the use of Inductio per Enumerationent
Simplicem in place of Scientihe induction.

(5) Another most important cause of failure is to be found in
Aristotle’s vague use of general terms. Words like motion, hot and
cold, moist and dry, heavy and light, generation and corruption,
natural and unnatural, tce„ are employed simply in their popular
acceptation, without any attempt to give them a definite and precise
meaning. The problems proposed for solution being thus wanting
in precision, it is not surprlsing that the results arrived at are vague
and unscientific. Under this head, cp. Herschel on the Study of

Natural Philosophy, Part ii. ch. 3, and Whewell’s History of the
inductive Sciences, Book i. ch. 2. sect. a.
(6) Lastly, 1 may add that Aristotle was often diverted from the study
