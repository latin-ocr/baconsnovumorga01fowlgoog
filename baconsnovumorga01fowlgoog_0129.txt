106 INTRODUCTION.

parfaite, pour atre l'auteur d’une revolution, et celle de Deseartes
devait reussir, parce qu'elle laissait subsistet une partie des erreurs.’
In the Histoire Moderne (which, however, appeared after the publica·
tion of the Encyclopedie), besides passing a high eulogium on Bacon‚
he gives a brief summary of a portion of the First Book of the Novum
Organum. See livre xx. ch. 12. It may be worth noticing that
Condillac’s objections to Bacon's threefold division of the sciences
are peculiarly acute and effective.

In 1751 appeared the Encyclopedie. This work not only contained
aflattering article on ‘Baconisme,' bnt, in the Discours Preliminaire
by D'Alembert, he is styled ‘ le plus grand, le plus universel, et le plus
eloquent des Philosophes.’ The exaggerated tone here adopted (as,
for instance, ‘Bacon ne dans le sein de la nuit la plus profonda, sentit
que la Philosophia n’etoit pas encore ’), as well as the fact that the
Encyclopedists claimed Bacon as one of themselves, not unnaturally

gave rise to a violent reaction against him, such as we witness in the
work of De Maistre.

It is unnecessary to pursue any further the subject of Bacon’s
reputation and influente in France, and we now turn to Italy.

That Bacon's works were well known and esteemed in Italy, even
during his lifetime‚ is plain from the following passage in the Life of
Baeon prefixed by Rawley to his Resuscitatio, published in 1657:

‘His fame is greater and sounds louder in foreign parts abroad,
thanat home in his own nation; thereby verifying that diuina
sentence, A prophetis normalitatem, save alahis ozon country,
and in his ozon house. Concerning which I will give you a taste only,
out of a letter written from Italy (the storehouse of refined wits)
to the late Earl of Devonshire, then the Lord Candish: I will expect
tlte neto essws ‘ff my Lord Choncellor Bacon, as alto his Hulory‚ with
a great deal os desz‘rc, and whatsoever else he shall composa: bul in
parit'culor ff nn Ht'story Ι promote mysels a thing perfect and singular,
especially in chry flu sevena, where de may exorciso the talen! ty his

spinis os thz's agn and lu is truly such. Now his farne doth not
decrease with days since, but rather increase. Divers of his works
have been anciently and yet lately translated into other tongues, both
learned and modern, by foreign pens!

Further evidence of the same fact is furnished by Bacon's cor·¹ ,
