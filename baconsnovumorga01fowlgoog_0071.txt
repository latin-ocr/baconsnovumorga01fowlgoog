‘Concerning the Means of procuring Unity; men must beware',
that in the procuring or muniting ol religious unity they do not
dissolve and deface the laws os charity and os human society. There
be two swords amongst Christiane, the spiritual and temporal; and
both have their due office and place in the maintenance ol religion.
But we may not talne up the third sword, which is Mahomet's sword,
or like unto it ; that is, to propagate religion by wara or by sanguinary
persecutions to force consciences; except it be in cases oi overt
scandal, blasphemy, or intennixture oi practice against the state;
much less to nourish seditions ; to authorise conspiracies and rebel-
lions; to put the sword into the people’s hands; and the like; tending
to the subversion oi all government, which is the ordinance of
God. For this is but to dash the first table against the second ;
and so to consider men as Christians, as we lorget that they are
rnen. Lucretius the poet, when he beheld the act oi Agamemnon,
that could endure the sacrificing oi his own daughter, exclaimed:

Tantum Relligio potuit suadere malorum:

What would he have said, if he had known of the massacre in
France, or the ponder treason of England? He would have been
seven times more Epicure and atheist than he was. Foras the
temporal sword is to be drawn with great circumspectiori in esses
of religion; so it is a thing monsuous to put it into the hands os
the common people. Let that be left unto the Anabaptists, and other
furies. It was great blasphemy when the devil said, Ι weil ascend and
be like the ffigtest,· but it is greater blasphemy to personate God,
and bring him in saying, I well descend, and be like the preiece of
darkness: and what isit better, to make the cause ol religion to
descend to the cruel and execrable actions of murthering princes,
butcbery of people‚ and subversion oi states and governmentsl
Surely this is to bring down the Holy Ghost‚ instead ol the like-
ness oi a dove, in the shape oia vulture or raven; and set out
os the barli oia Christian church a flag oia berk oi pirates and
Ass-assius. Therelore it is most necessary that the church by doctrine
3ηά decree‚ princes by their sword, and all learnings‚ both Christian
and moral, as by their Mercury rod, do damn and send to hell ior
ever those facts and opinions tending to the support oi the same; as
bath been already in good part done. Surely in counsels concerning
religion, that counscl oi the apostle would be prefixed, Ira domabis
non einplet justdtirm Dei. And it was a notable observation os a wise
father, and no less ingenuously confessed; that those whe'ch held and
