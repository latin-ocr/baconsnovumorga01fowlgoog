Δ “ INTRODUCTION. 113

ln the Dedication to the Royal Society of his Scepsis Scientifica
(1665), Glanvill says: ‘For you really are what former ages could
contrive but in wish and Romances3 and Solomon's House in the
New Atlantis was a Prophetic Scheme of the Royal Society.' Com· ,
plimentary allusione to Bacon, whom he evidently regards as the
great light of modern philosophy, are of constant occurrence in
Glanville's works. Mr. Napier cites one more, taken from the Plus
Ultra or the Progress and Advancement of Knowledge since the days
of Aristotle (1668), having special reference to the Royal Society.
After several remarks on the philosophy and aims of Bacon, he
proceeds:

‘This was a mighty design, groundedly laid, wisely exprest‚ and
happily recommended by the Glorious Author, who began nobly,
and directed with an incomparable conduct of Wit and Judgment:
But to the carrying it on, it was necessary there should be many
Heads and many Hands and those formed into an Assembly, that
might intercommunicate their Tryals and Observations‚ that might
joyntly work, and j0yntly consider; that so the improvable and luciferous
Phaenomena, that lie scatter'd up and down in the vast Champaigtt
of Nature, might be aggregated and brought into a common store.
This the Great Man desired‚ and form'd a Society of Experimenters
in a Romantick Model, but could do no more; His time was not
ripe for such performances.’

‘These things therefore were consider'd also hythe later VirtuosI,
who several of them combined together, and set themselves on work
upon this grand Design²⁰.'

Oldenburg, the first Secretary of the Society, in Number aa, p. 39¹
(1666-7), giving an extract from a letter, continues: ‘The ingenious
Author of this Letter, as he expresses an extraordinary desire t0 see
the Store-House of Natural Philosophy more richly iraughted (a
Work begun by the single care and conduct of the excellent Lord
Verulam, and prosecuted hythe Joynt-undertahings of the Royal
Society) so,’ &o He frequently allodes to Bacon, as having given
the chief impulse to the study of Experimental Philosophy, as, for
instance, in the Prefaces to the Transactions for 1670,1672,1677.
Thus, in the Preface for 1670, he says that ‘his greatest Reputation
rebounded first from the most intelligent Forrainers in many parts
of Christendome;’ in that for 1672, ‘when our renowned Lord
Bacon had demonstrated the methods for a perfect Restauration of
