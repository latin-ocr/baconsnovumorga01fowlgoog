01 the state. It required experiences 11110 those 01 the French
Revolution to convince men that the dissolution 01 the restraints
01 religion, 10 11110110 which lrom insancy had been accustomed to
them, might be even still more desolating in its effects on morals
and government. And meanwhile, this view, as stated by Bacon,
bore fruit and multiplied. The undiscriminating denunciation 01
Superstition in the seventeenth century, coupled with the 11001 mode
01 enquiry 1010 the fundamentals 01 religion which marked the close
01 the period, terminated 10 1000110, which, however much 110 may ι
have contributed 10 them, 110 would probably have been among the
last to welcome,

8111 The last point which Ι shall notice is also one which had
a great and undoubted 011001 00 subsequent speculation. The

What he, above all things, desired was a clear and unimpeded course

and controversialists 01 his time would never have allowed hiru to
lorget) what he states so emphatically in the Novum 0130011011,
‘quod nacta sit Philosophia Naturalis per omnes aetates adversarium
molestum et difficilem; superstitionem nimirum, et zelum religionis
00000100110101011010111111.’ What then so 0110011101, and what so obvious,
as to declare 00 entire separation between the spheres 01 8010000 0011
Theology, 01 Reason and Faith? Their admixture had made the
one 1001110110, 0011 the other heretical. The remedy, therefore, was
to put thern asunder; to give 10 reason the things 01 reason, and
to saith the things 01 saith. Then, the one would declare the Will
01 God‚ and the other His Power²⁶. Nor was the idea 01 this truce,
1 think, suggested solely by the motive ol preserving the rights 01
0010000. 11 was 10 perfect sincerity, 11111011, that Bacon wrote,
‘Concludamus igitur, Theologiam Sacram ex verbo et oraculis Dei,
