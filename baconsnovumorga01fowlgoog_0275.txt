ipsius vitiosae sunt3 sensus enim et destituit et t'allit. At
destitutionibus substitutiones, fallaciis rectificationes deben-
tur⁶⁷. Secund0, notiones ab impressionibus sensuum male
abstrahuntur, et interminatae et confusae sunt, quas ter-
minatas et bene finitas esse oportuit. Tertio, inductio mala
est, quae per enumerationem simplicem principia concludit
scientiarum, non adhibitis exclusionibus et solutionibus sive
separationibus naturae debitis ⁰⁸. Postrem0, modus ille in·
veniendi et probandi, ut primo principia maxime generalia
constituantur, deinde media axiomata ad ea applicentur et

(3) We employ the vicious method of Inductio per Enumerationem
simplicem

(4) We ily off at once to the principia maxime generalia, instead
of ascending to them gradually through the axiomata infima and media.

⁶⁷ Bacon might have added that the substitutions are to be supplied
mainly by instruments, the rectificatione mainly by methods.

⁸⁸ ln opposition to the ordinary method of Inductio per Enumerationem
simplicem, Bacon proposes a method of elimination. lt is not, however,
quite clear what is the precise character of the method which he has in view.
We may talre his words either in ageneral sense or with special reference to
- the methods described in Book ii. lnthe former case. the passage might be
paraphrasedasfollows: ‘We oughtto excludeallinstanceswhich donot throw
light on the object oi euquiry, resolve complex into more simple casea, and
isolate phenomena so as to simplify our investigations.’ According to
the latter alternative, he bas in mind the process described in Blr. ii. Aphs.
18,19‚ The true method oi induction, Bacon appears to have thought,
was to draw up tables of presence, absence, dte, and then, by means of
these, to reject out of all the possible explanations, causes, or forms ol the
phenomenon‚ first one, and then another, thus leaving a residuum oi expla-
nations, or possible causes, out ol which the true one was to be found.
lf one only remained, this would be the true explanation, cause, or ‘form,’
‘forma affirmativa, solida, et vera, et bene terminata' (ii. 16). lf more
than one remained, the ‘exclusiva' might be perfected by means of the
‘praerogativae instantiarum’ and other ‘ aids ol the understanding’ (see
ii. 21), till, at last, the search was narrowed down to some one ‘form,’
which would be the form required, or to a small number amongst which
the true form, cause, or explanation would have to be sought in all future
investigations. For further information on Bacon's ‘ Method of Exclusions,'
see Introduction, ὁ 9.

⁶⁰ See note on Aph. 19, where it is shewn that the fault lies not so much
in framing these wide hypotheses, as in taking thern sor ascertained truths
and not insisting on their due verification.
