distilled water at 4⁰C. The specihc gravity of Platinum is still greater
than that of gold.

⁶⁶ This conception of Weigbt is perfectly correct. Weight, which is the
amount of the earth’s attraction on a body, depends not on the consisteucy
of the body, buton the amount of matter contained in it. And, as the
amount of mutter or mass¹ depends partly on the volume and partly on the
density, two bodies of equal volume will vary iu weight according to their
respective densities.

⁶⁷ ‘The contrary of glaring are “clandestine instances,” where “the
nature sought is exhibited in its wealrest and most imperfect state.” of
this, Bacon himself has given an admirable example in the cohesion of
fluids, as a clandestine leutance of the “nature or quality of consistence, or
solidity.” Yet here, again, the same acute discrimination which enabled
Bacon to perceive the analogy. which connects fluids with solids, through
the common property of cohesive attraction, would, at the same time, have
enabled him to draw from it, if properly supported, every consequence
necessary to forming just notions of the cohesive force; nor does its
reference to the class of clandestine instances at all assist in bringing
forward and maturing the final results. When, however, the final result is
obtained—when our inductiou is complete, and we would verify it,-this
class of instances is of great use, being, in fact, frequently no other than
that of extreme cases, such as we have already spoken of; which, by placing
our conclusions‚ as it were, in violent circumstances, try their temper, and
bring their vigour to the test! Herschel’s Discourse, § 19 3.

‘An example of this instance may be given from hydrostatics. If the sus-
pension os water in capillary tubes be inquired into, it becomes very useful to
view that effect when it is least, or when the tube ceases to be capillary, and
becomes a vessel of a large diameter. The column is then reduced to a
slender ring oi water, which goes all round the vessel; and this, though
now so inconsiderable, has the property oi being independent of the size of
the vessel, so as to be iu all cases the sante when the materials are the
same. As there can be no doubt that this ring proceeds from the attrac-
tion of the sides, and of the part immediately above the water, so there can
be no doubt tbat the capillary suspensiou, in part at least, is derived from
