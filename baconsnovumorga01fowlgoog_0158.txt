Buconical Philosophers' ‘this Bacon-faced generation,' tre. (showing,
by the way, pretty conclusively, the influence which was already
supposed to be exercised by Bacon’s philosophy), and, as a professed
admirer ol the old learning, somewhat inconsistently ‘declares that
the Lord Bacon did steal the principal parts of his Novum Organum
out of Aristotle, and only disguised his Suggestions in a new Mode
and Dress.' Similarly, the Advancement oi Leaming was stolen
from Ludovicus Vives, De causis corruptarum Artium ⁶⁰. ‘The
only judgment I can make ol my Lord Bacon's Aetings, is, that
being so Flagitious, and so ignominiously degraded: He determined
to redeem the Infamy ol his past life by amusing the world with
New Projects; and to gain a Chancellorship in Literature, when he
was excluded from thatun the Bench: And to revenge himself of the
Nation whom he had exasperated, by diffusing Heresies in Philosophy,
and creating in the Breasts of the English such a desire ol Novelty,

Passing to the middle ol the eighteenth century, when Bacon was
at the zenith ol his glory, we find the chorus oi approbation broken
by the modified praise rather than the disparagement of Hume. The
weapon which Hume wielded, comparison with philosophers who
have made positive contributions to sciense, is one which has since

⁵⁰ Having occasion to compare a remedy against the swearlng-sielness given by
Holinshed the Chronicler with one given by Bacou, he says: ‘The works of the
former will be much more valued than the latter by our nation, as long as they
heve any judgment. The truth is the Lord Baoon is like great piles; when the
Sun is not high, they cast an extraordinary sbadow over the earth, which lesseneth
as the Suu gruum verticall! Iegends no Histories, pp. 27, 28.
