60 INTRODUCTION.

To understand his meaning, those passages should be carelully
studied in connection with each other as wellas with the various
places where he speaks ol the discovery of Forms.

The complex substances and operations ol nature admitted, he
conceived, as we have already seen in the section on ‘Forms,' os
being broken up into a few ‘simple natures,' just as the numerous
words os a language are composed ola small number· ol simple
sounds or letters. The first business of scienoe, then, wasto ascertain
the ‘forms’ ol these simple natures. This might, he supposed, be
effected by means oi the ‘Method of Exclusions.' The number os
‘simple natures' being limited, and, as he seems to have thought,
at least ultimately ascertainable, ii we wish to find with what other·
nature any given nature is invariably connected (this phrase is mine,
not his) either as an effect or as a species, we have nothing to do
but to go on ascertaining with what natures it is nol so connected.
And il we can succeed in excluding all but one, it follows that this
is the nature ol which we are in search. ‘Est itaque Inductionis
verae opus primum (quatenus ad inveniendas formas) rejectio sive
exclusiva naturarum singularum, quae non inveniuntur in aliqua
instantia, ubi natura data adest ; aut inveniuntur in aliqua instantia,
ubi natura data abest; aut inveniuntur in aliqua instantia crescere,
cum natura data decrescat; aut decrescere, cum natura data crescat.
Tum vero post rejectionem et exclusivam debitis modis laetam, secundo
loco (tanquam in fundo) manebit (abeuntibus in sumum opinionibus
volatilibus) sonna affirmativa, solida, et vera, et bene terminata ³⁰3 In
the present state of knowledge, however, he does not seem to think
. this ideal attainable. ‘Neque vero ipsa exclusiva ullo modo perlecta
est, neque adeo esse potest sub initiis' (ii. 19). Hence the necessity
not only ol the ‘Tables’ but also of the ‘praerogativae instantiarum’
and other ‘aids ol the intellect' in order to complete, as lar as
may be, the ‘Exclusiva’ as well as ol some method ol clearing up
our conceptione oi the ‘simple natures' (which method he like·
wise regarded as inductive, though be says nothing further about it ⁴⁰.
See i. 14‚18). ‘ltaque nos, qui nec ignari sumus, nec obliti, quantum
opus aggrediamur, (viz. ut iaciamus intellectum humanum rebus et
naturae parem) nullo modo acquiescimus in his, quae adhuc prae·

⁴⁰ llalrlr &qugd ld'think that Bacou supposed the work ol clearing up our eon·
ceptions and that of establishing true axioma would proce-ed pari passu, though
Mr. Ellis (General Presace. p. 37) is apparently ol a diilerent opinion. See my note
on u. 19.
