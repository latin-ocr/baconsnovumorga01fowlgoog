552 Novum occanum

Nobis autem corporum naturalium appetitus ubique serio
perscrutantibus occurrit iste motus; et constitui debere videtur
in speciem. Est autem hic motus veluti aeternae cujusdam
captivitatis. Videlicet ubi corpora non omnino pro natura
sua bene locata, et tamen non prorsus male se habentia,
perpetuo trepidant, et irrequiete se agant, nec statu suo l
contenta, nec ulterius ausa progredi. Talis invenitur motus
in corde et pulsibus animalium; et necesse est ut sit in
omnibus corporibus, quae statu ancipiti ita degunt inter
commoda et incommoda, ut distracta liberare se tentent, et
denuo repulsam patiantur, et tamen perpetuo experiantur⁵⁵.

( 19) Sit Motus Decimus Nonus et postremus motus ille cui
vix nomen motus competit, et tamen est plane motus Quem

in virtue of which its equinoxes described small circles of nine degrees
radius about those of the ninth or next superior orb. To account ior this
motion they introduced a tenth orb. The phenomenon, however, thus
accouuted for was altogether imaginary, although it is true that the length
os the tropical year, by supposed variations of which the idea of trepida-
tion was suggested, is not rigorously coustant. lt may be questioned

whether Bacou’s hesitation to accept the astronomical motion of trepida· ,

tion had any better foundation than his doubts whether the proper motions ³
of the planetary orbs were anything more than “res confictae et suppo-

sitae.” [See Aph. 3⁶ (a).] The question ot the existence or non· ,

existence ol trepidation could only be decided by a person conversant with
the details of the received system ol astronomy.’ Mr. Ellis' note.

⁶⁶ Cp. Historia Densi et Rari, E. and 8, vol. ii. p. 263: ‘Pulsus cordis 3
et arteriarum irr animalibus fit per irrequietum dilatationem spirituum, et Ϊ

receptum ipsorum, per vices! ln reading vague and fancisul passages like l
these, we must recollect that Harvey did not begin to teach his theory os l

the circulation of the blood till 1619, and that it was not till 1628 that his
great treatise, the ‘Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in
Animalibus' was published. Bacon might, it is true, have derived more
precise views than those which he expresses from earlier writers, but there
was nothing specially to direct his attention to this subject.

The Tides and the astronomical phenomena of Nutation and Libration
might sumish appropriate instances ol the ‘Motus Trepidationis?

⁶⁸ Decubitus=lying away from, sc. motion. See F acciolati on decubo. 1

He quotes Fabius Pictor apud Aul. Geli. lib. re. cap. 15: ‘Pedes lecti, in =
quo cubat [sc. Flamen DiallsJ, luto tenui circumlitos esse oportet: et de χ
eo lecto trinoctium continuum non decubat: neque in eo lecto cubare ¹

aliurn fas est! Decubitus might, however, simply mean ‘lying down: ‘rt‘-
cliuing,’ ‘repose.' (Cp. decumbo)
