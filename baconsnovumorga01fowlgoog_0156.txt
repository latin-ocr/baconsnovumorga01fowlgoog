conversation with the writer, applied 3 very unsavoury epithet. Nor,
perhaps, did he like Bacon personally; lor (p. 226) ‘Da Harvey told
me his eie was like the eie ol a viper.' Be this as it may, the opinion
was not an unnatural nor altogether an unlair one, as expressed by a
man oi great eminence in a particular branch of seleuce, ol one who
attempted to make all science his province. Then as now,l presume,
the philosopher 3ηά the specialist were apt to misunderstand and
undervalue each other.

Mr. Napier refers to a work of Alexander Ross, a voluminous
author, well-known to the readers ol HudibraS, entitled Arcana Micro·
cosmi, or the Hid Secrets of Man's Body discovered; with aRefutation,
amongst other books, ol ‘Lord Bacon’s Natural History,’ 1652. (The
copy in the Bodleian is the Ed. of 1651, containing only the refu-
tation of Dr. Browne’s Vulgar Errors, 3ηά not that oi Bacon's Sylva
Sylvarum.) The author says: ‘I have cursorily run over my Lord's

Ross is a very zealous Aristotelian, and at the end of his attack on
Dr. Browne, ‘pities to see so many young heads, still gaping like

some viands oi Peripatetick visdom, they reJect Aristotle's pure
Fountains, and dig to themselves cisterna that will hold no water!
‘Let us not wander then any longer with Hagar in the wild desart.'
‘Let Prodigals sorsake their husks, and leave them to swine.'

ln Francis Osbom's Miscellany (1659), The Author to the Reader,
there is a curious sentence, shewing how early the charge ol Atheism
was directed against Bacon. Alter speaking ol Raleigh having
been branded with the title ol an Atheist, ‘though 3 known asserter of

God and providence‚’ the writer goes on to say: ‘A like censure fell '

to the share oi venerable Bacon, till over-balanced by a greater weight
oi glory from Strangers!

Cudworth, in his Intellectual System (published in 1678), attacks
Bacon for having called in question the received doctrine of Final
causes. He seems doubtful, however, what interpretation to put on
his words Thus, having spoken ol ‘some who have unskilsully

attributed their own Properties to Inanimate Bodies,' he proceeds to
say: ‘ot which Fauciful Extravagances it the Advancer ol Learning
