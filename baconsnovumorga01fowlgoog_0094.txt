of facts, and prevented from perceiving the due significance ol those

which he did observe‚ by his eagemess to discover illustrations of his
favourite metaphysical distinctions, such as δύναμις and ἐνέργεια, the ten
categories with their subdivisions, the sour causes, the different kinds
ol motion, and the like. His partiality lor assigning the linal rather
than the efficient causes ol phenomena is specially to be noticed
under this head, as having osten led him to the perversiori ol laets or
to erroneous generalisations. This a priori mode of investigation, the
disposition to look out lor illustratione of preconceived maxims or
ideas instead of patiently considering what conclusions the lacts lead
to, is peculiarly opposed to the Baconian method and the spirit ol
modern science.

Briefly to sum up, Aristotle's collection ol facts was often inade-
quate either in number or character to form a basis ol induction‚ his
method was osten unscientific, his ideas were often vague and indis-
tinct, and his fundamental maxims and distinctions were generally
preconceived and assumed rather than gathered from experience and
reasoningtt

It should, however, be recollected that scientific ideas, adequate and
appropriate. to the explanation ol scientific facts, are usually the slow
growth ol time, and occur to men only as the sequel os many unsuc-
cessful efforts. Even had Aristotle's collection of laets been more
complete and accurate than it was, they had hardly been known suffi-
ciently long to suggest either to him or others the conceptions which
were adequate to connect and explain them. We are not perhaps
justified in expecting the master to have effected more than he did.
The fault was in the scholare, who, instead ol carrying on the master's
work, contented themselves with blindly howing to his authority, and
repeating his maxims. This undiscriminating admiration naturally, in
its turn, provoked the reaction, often almost equally undiscriminating,
ol which I proceed to treat in the next section.

⁸⁰ Eucken (quoted by Lange, Geschichte des Materialismus, and Ed.,v01. i.
p. 135) refers Aristotle's lailure in his physical researches almost exclusively to the
want of scientific instrumeuts, but, as Lange remarks, the modems began their work
ol discovery with almost exactly the same scientific appliances as the aucients, and
invented the instrumente as they proceeded in their researches.
