pieces, such as the Sententiae Duodecim, the Temporis Partus'
Masculus the Inquisitio de lllotu, δια, are written in Latin, and
it is hardly likely that Bacon would have thought it worth while to
have these imperfect essays translated for him.

Again, Ι may mention that the MS. of the Cogitata et Visa,
which I have personally inspected. is corrected throughout in Bacon’s
own haud-writing‚ and in such a manner as to shew that he was
perfectly familiar with the proprieties of Latin composition ¹⁸. More·
over, in the Commentarius Solutus or Bacon’s Common-Place Book,
now in the British Museum (Add. MS. 27,278), the entries are made
almost indifferently in English and Latin.

Lastly, the Latin of, at least, the First Book of the Novum
Organum, rugged and unclassical as it often is ¹⁹, seems to me so
distinctly to hear the mark of genius, and of the same kind of
genius that we find stamped on Bacon's English expression, that
1 should feel it very difficult to referit to any of the men who sur·
rounded Bacon rather than to Bacon himself.

Μ. BACON'S GENERAL PHILOSOPlllCAL OPINIONS.

Bacon nias not the founder of a philosophical school. Indeed,
there is no character which he would himself have more indignantly
repudiated. ‘Primo itaque postulandum videtur, ne existiment ho·
mines, nos, more antiquorum Graecorum, aut quorundam novorum
hominum, sectam aliquam in philosophia condere velle³⁰.' But,
though not the founder of any special school of philosophy, it seems
to me unquestionable that his exposition of his method‚ and, perhaps
also individual expressions in his writings‚ contributed in no small
degree to the creation of what is commonly called the empirical

¹⁸ lt may be noticed that in Bucon's letter to Andrewes (Spedding's letters and
Life, vol. iv. p. 141), he asks his correspondent ¹ to mark unto me whatsoever shall
seem unto you either not current in the style: &c This is hardly the language of
aman who was not himself responsible for the style. Cp. the Postscript to Bodley's
Ietter to Bacon, published in ‘Remulus' pp. 85-87.

¹⁹ That l'acon had formed for himself an ideal of Latin composition, for the pur·
poscs for which he required it, and an ideal just such as we lind exemplified in the
Novum Orgnnum, is plain from the account given by Tenison (Buconiana p. 26)
of his discontent with Dr. Playfer's performance: 'Upon this great occasion he'
(Dr. Playfer) 'would be over-accuratu and he sent a Specimen of such superfine
Latinity that the Lord Bacon did not encourage him to labour further iu that work,
in the penning of which he desired not so much neat and polite, as clear, masculine,
and apt expression! '³ Nov.0rg.i.116.·
