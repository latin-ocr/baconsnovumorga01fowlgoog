Atque de instantiis crvcis haec dicta sint. Longiores autem

inter praerogativas instantiarum ponemus loco decimo
quinto Instantias Divartii,· quae indicant separationes natu·
rarum earum quae ut plurimum occurrunt ²⁰. Differunt autem
ab instantiis quae subjunguntur instantiis comitatas²¹; quia illae
indicant separationes naturae alicujus ab aliquo concreto cum
quo illa familiariter consuescit, hae vero separationes naturae
alicujus ab altera natura ²². Differunt etiam ab instantiis
crucis,· quia nihil determinant, sed monent tantum de separa·

¹⁸ A full account of this experiment is given in Sylva sylvarum, Exp. 3¹·
Mr. Ellis there remarks: ‘The explanation oi this experiment is simply
that in impure air flames increase in siae because the heated vapour of
which they are composed diffuses itself before it meets with sufficient
oxygeu ior complete combustion’

Bacon may, perhaps, be credited with having seen, in a dim sort of way,
that air had some connection with ilame, but the whole oi this speculation,
like the two preceding ones, is wide oi the mark.

¹⁹ Bacon, then, regarded these instances as affording certainty, and,
supposing the various alternatives to be stated exhaustively and the
observations or experimeuts to be properly selected and rightly conducted,
they would do so.

²¹ The lnstantiae subjunctivae of Aph. 34.

²¹ These instances seem to differ from the ‘instantiae Hostiles’ oi
Aph. 33 only in form. There a ‘nature’ is adduced as ‘hostile' to or
dissociated from some particular kind oi concrete body3 here one ‘nature'
is adduced as dissociated in certain cases, or iu certain kinds oi bodies,
from some other nature. But the difference seems to consist solely in the
mode of stating the propositions, abstract terms or ‘natures' being em·
ployed both in subject and predicate in the one case, and, in the other, an
abstract term or ‘nature ' being deuied oi some concrete body.

lt might be said, by way oi suggesting a difference, that the ‘ Instantiae
Divortii' are exceptions to general mles, but then the ‘instantiae Hostiles'

so sagn as we can make out from the examples, seem to have this character
as w .
