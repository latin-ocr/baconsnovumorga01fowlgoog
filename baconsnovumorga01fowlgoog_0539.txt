in visu (cujus actio est pemicissima) liquet etiam requiri ad
eum actuandum momenta certa temporis: idque probatur ex
iis quae propter motus velocitatem non cernuntur ; ut ex
latione pilae ex sclopeto²⁶. Velocior enim est praetervolatio
pilae quam impressio speciei ejus quae deserri poterat ad
visum.

Atque hoc, cum similibus, nobis quandoque dubitationem
peperit plane monstrosamil: videlicet, utrum coeli sereni
et stellati iacies ad idem tempus cernatur quando vere existit,
an potius aliquanto post ; et utrum non sit (quatenus ad
visum coelestium) non minus tempus verum et tempus visum,
quam locus verus et locus visus, qui notatur ab astronomis in
parallaxibus²⁸. Adeo incredibile nobis videbatur, species
sive radios corporum coelestium per tam immensa spatia
milliarium subito deferri posse ad visum3 sed potius debere
casin tempore aliquo notabili delabi. Verum illa dubitatio

sound has been actually ascertained. This in dry air and at 0⁰0. is about
1093 ft. in a second. ,

There are many stories of the distances at-which sounds have been .
heard. The firing at Waterloo is said to have been heard at Dorer, and

· sometimes the reports of cannonorvolcanoes are said to bave been carried ³

distances of aoo, or even 300 mileo.

³⁶ This incapacity is due partly to the colour of the ball (for we do see a
rocket), partly to the lact that the eye cannot adjust itself with sufficient
rapidity to its constantly changing positione.

Note again, in the language of the neat sentence, the traces ol the old
, theory os ‘sensible species? Cp. Aph. 4 3 and note 9²·

ῃ lt is almost needless to say that this ‘dubitatio plane monstrosa' has

been amply justified. ‘The measurement of the Velocity of light: says
Professor Playlair, ‘and the wonderfirl consequences an'sing from it, are
the best commentarios on this passage, and the highest eulogy on its
Author! .
Talring the velocity of light at 190‚ooo miles asscendit requires
8³¹ 18¹ to traverse a semi-diameter nithe eartb's orbit. From this it is
calculated that the light which the very nearest tired stars sendus must
take at least 33 years to reach us, while the light of some of the stara in the
gelaxy must have occupied more than aooo years in travelling over the
distance which separates them from our own system. See, ior more
detailed information, Herschel's Astronomy, roth Ed„ §i θοι-3.
