which Newton inherited directly from the teaching of Bacon. And,
though the reaction against hypothesis was carried much too far, and
though Bacon’s utterances on this subject, to be serviceable at the
present time, require much rectification, the waming was one which,
in his own time, was sorely needed, and which could hardly be
expressed in language too emphatic. Where authority was wanting,
as if by way of revenge, men seemed to put no limit to the wildness
of their fancies or the extravagance of their suppositions Now, as
against both authority and hypothesis, Bacon invoked the majesty of ’
facts. The office of Reason, he was, in effect, constantly saying,
ought not to be limited to an examination of the conclusione, and
their dependance on the premisses ; what it ought to insist on doing,
is to examine the premisses themselves. What is required is a new
Logic,a Logic of Induction, which shall do for the premisses what
the old Logic, the Logic of Deduction, does for the conclusione. It
is not enough that the conclusion follows from the premisses; what
we require to know is whether the premisses themselves be true, and,
unless we can succeed in satisfying this want, we may simply be
multiplying error instead of advancing truth. Had this been the only
lesson which Bacon read to his generatim, he would, assuredly, have
deserved to be reckoned amongst the greatest of its benefactore.

oth, But, to this Logic of Induction l maintain that he himself
made no contemptible contributione. That our instances require to
be selected and not merely accumulated, was avery true and a very
needful lesson which he was never weary of repeating. And, surely,
in this marrim consiste the whole gist of the inductive Logic. On
what principles we shall select our instances and by what means we
shall satisfy ourselves of their sufficiency, are other and lirrther ques·
tions, consessedly most difficult to answer, on which we could hardly
expect much detailed or permanently aseful information from a
pioneer in this method of inquiry. And yet Bacon is very full ou
at least the first of these questions, and much of what he says has,
even still, a value for the student. But we are now coneemed, we
must recollect, not with the present value of his worlts, but with their
past influence. Now, to the amount of that influence, with respect to
the subject before us, what better testimony can we have than the
repetition of these rules in the next generation by so eminent a man
of scicnce as Dr. Robert Hoolre, or the appropriation, emendation,
and formulation of them, as the bases of their own methods, almost
within our own time, by Sir John Herschel and Mr. Mill? Nor is it
an unhnportant consideration that such phrases as ⁴ glaring instance:
