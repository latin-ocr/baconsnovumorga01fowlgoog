ff 3.RELAT10N OF THE NOVUM ORGANUM TO THE MORE
IMPORTANT OF BACON'S OTHER PHILOSOPHICAL wokKS.

In his letter to Father Fulgentio, which lllr. Spedding refers to
1625 ¹, Bacon says: ‘Equidem memini me, quadraginta abhinc annis,
juvenile opusculum circa has res confecisse, quod magna prorsus
fiducia et magnifico titulo “Temporis Partum Maximum '' inscripsi'
This would shew that, at or about the early age of twenty-five, Bacon
had already begun to contemplate the Renovatlon of Science. But
the first form in which this idea occurred to him seems to have been
to write a great work on the Interpretation of Nature, that is, on the
new method of Induction². Of this, we have some fragments in
't' alerius Terminus, the whole or tbe greater part of which seems to
have been written about 1603 or 1604 ³. lt is needless to add
that Bacon's idea was afterwards far more fully carried out, in
part at least, by the Novum Organum. Of the much more ex·
tended scheme of the Great Instauration in six parts, we have the
first intimati0n⁴ in the Partis Instaurationis Secundae Delineatlo et
Argumentum, which Mr. Spedding thinks ‘may be referred with toler-
able confidence to the 1011111606 01 1607 ’ζ’ and certainly to some
time prior to the composition of the Cogitata et Visa, which, iu its
first form, seems to have been composed in the summer or autumn
of 1607t Both these works are interesting as covering much of
the same ground as the Novum Organum, and may profitably be
compared with it and with one another. ¹

Of the Great Instauration, no part, as Mr. Ellis truly says, can be
regarded as absolutely complete, though the first part, the Parti-
tiones Scientiarum, pointing out what had been done and what
remained to be done in the various sciences, is more adequately
represented than any other. This is contained in the De Augmentis‚
published in 1623 (about three years aller the publication of the

lllr. Spedding’s remarks on this subject, vol. i. pp. 103-106. The name Instaura·
