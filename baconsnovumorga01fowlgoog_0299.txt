⁸³ Aph. 77. Cp. notes on that Aphorism‚ and also the passage iu my
Inductive Logic (3rd ed, pp. 28 5-293) there referred to. To the instances
of extravagant respect for authority given in those places, the reader may
add the following tahen from Galileo's rst Dialogue (Sir Thomas Salus·
bury's Translation‚ pp. 91-3).

‘Sacranos l found one day, at home iu his house, at Venice, a famous
phisician, to whom some floclrt for their studies, and others out of
curiosity sometimes came thither to see certain anatomies dissected by
the hand ofa no lesse learned, than careful and experienced anatomist.
lt chanced upon that day, when 1 was there, that he was in search of
the original aud rise of the nerves, about which there is a famous con-
troversie between the Galenists and Peripateticks3 and the anatomist
shewing, how that great number of nervas departing from the braiu, as
their root, and passing by the nape of the neck, disteud themselves after·
wards along by the back-bone, and branch themselves thorow all the body;
and that a very small filament, as fine as a thred‚ went to the heart;
he turned to a gentleman whom he hnew to be a Peripatetici philosopher,
and for whose salte he had with extraordinary exactnesse, discovered and
proved every thing, aud demanded of him, if he was at length satisfied and
perswaded that the original of the nerves proceeded from the brain, and not
from the hearti To which the philosopher, after he had stood musing
a while, answered3 you have made me to see this businesse so plainly and
seusibly, that did not the text of Aristotle assert the contrary, which
positively affirmeth the nerves to proceed from the beart, l should be
constrained to confesse your opinion to be true!

‘Snavmrus And there are certain gentlemen yet living, and in health‚
who were present, when a doctor, that was professor in a famous aca-
demy, bearing the description of the telescope, by him not seen as then,
said that the Invention was taken from Aristotle, and causing bis works to
be fetch’t, he turned to a place where the philosopher gives the reason,
whence it commeth, that from the bottom ofa very deep well, one may see
the stam in heaven at noon day; and, addressing himself to the company,
see here, saith he, the well, which representeth the tube, see here the gross
vapours, from whence is taken the invention of the crystals, aud see here
lastly the sight fortilied by the passage of the rays through a diaphonous,
but more dense and obscure medium!

On the immoderate reverence for Antiquity and Authority, cp. De
Augmentis, lib. i. (E. and S., vol. i. pp. 456—459). This passage, though
full of interest, is too long for quotation.

⁸³ The thought which Bacon here elaborates‚ is summed up in one short
Aphorism in the parallel passage of De Augmentis lib. i.: ‘Sane, ut verum
