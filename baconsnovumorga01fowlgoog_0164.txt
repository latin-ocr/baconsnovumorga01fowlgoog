tions were carried on ior the sake of reward; the ‘Historia Vitae
et Mortis' was written with the view of augmenting his influence over

the King, and was ‘intended to justily the inclination of certain
persons about the court lor the pleasures ol the table, as well as
other appetitas, and to diminish their lear of death! Notwithstanding
all these aspersions, we are told at the end of the article that ‘we
must not lorget that Bacon, above all others, saw and comprehended
the value and the importance os natural science lor the purposes
ol lite: while ‘Bacon's Essays are unexceptionable documents testi·
sying os his genius and sagacity, as well as ol his prolound knowledge
and correct appreciation of human relations and the different con·
ditions ol men⁶⁹.'

Both Liebig and Lasson lay considerable stress on the crude ,

character of many ol the observations and experimenta recorded in
the Sylva Sylvarum. lt is only fair, therefore, to Bacon’s memory to
quote what is said by Rawley in his introduction to that work ⁶⁰.
‘I have heard his lordship osten say, that il he should have served the
glory of his own name, he had been better not to have published this
Natural History ; lor it may seem an indigested heap of particulars,
and cannot have that lustre which bools cast into methods have;
but that he resolved to preler the good ol men, and that which might
best secure it, belore anyth'mg that might have relation to himself!
‘And I have heard his lordship spealr complainingly‚ that his lord-

should be forced to be a workman and a labentes, and to dig the clay
and burn the brick; and more than that, (according to the hard
condition ol the Israelites at the latter end) to gather the straw and
stubble over all the tields to burn the bricks withal! Nor is the Sylva
Sylvarum so contemptible as Bacon's adversaries represent it to be.
lt is probably far the best and most complete single collection of
the kind that, up to that time, had been published.

Even Liebig is almost outdone by his French translator, M. de
Tchihatchel (Lord Bacon, Paris, and Ed. 1877). The following may
serve as choiee examples of the indignation which Baeon arouses in
the breast of this modern philosopher ⁸¹. ‘Paracelse etait presque
