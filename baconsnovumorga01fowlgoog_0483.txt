quando latus unum pelvis alluit, deserit alterum3 vel a sub-
latione et subsidentia aquarum e profundo, in modum aquae
ebullientis et rursus subsidentis⁷⁴. Utri vero causae fluxus
et refluxus ille assignari debeat, oritur dubitatio. Quod si
recipiatur prior assertio, necesse est ut cum sit fluxus in mari
ex una parte, fiat sub idem tempus alicubi in mari refluxus

exalia. Itaque ad hoc reducitur inquisitio. Atqui observam't ἵ

to run to and again the long wayes of it, and to rise and fall in its fi

extreames, who will make scrupie of granting, that the said effect may,
nay ought to succeed in the sea-waters, contained within their vessels,

subject to such like alterations, aad especially in those that distend thern·

selves long-wayes from West to East, which is the course that the motion
of those same vessels steereth? Now this is the most potent and primary
cause of the ebbing and flowing, without the which no such effect would
eusue' Sir Thomas Salusbury’s Translatioa, pp. 389-390. See F lorence
Ed. of 1842, vol. i. pp. 4⁶2·4· The idea that the tides are due to the
influence of the moon is alluded to aad ridiculed by Galileo a few pages
above. See p. 455 (Sir Thomas Salusbury's Translation, p. 383). ll 1⁵
noticed hy Mr. Ellis (E. and S, vol. iii. p. 44) that Galileo’s theory was
flrst propounded in a letter to Cardlnal Orsino, dated 1616. This isto be
found in the F lorence Edition of Galileo’s Worls, vol. ii. pp. 3⁸7·l0⁶·

⁷⁴ From what follows, it is plain that Bacon, had he adopted this alterna·
tive, would have explained it by a magnetic force, attracting the waters
But, as ΜΓ. Ellis says (E. aud 8., vol. iii. p. 41), ‘One theory, that of
Telesius and Patricius, compares the sea to the water in a caldron; that is
to say, it rises and tends to hoil over when its natural heat is called forth
under the influence of the sun, moon, and stars, and then after a while
subsides! On this, and the other curious theories by which the action of

the tides was explained by Bacon’s predecessors and contemporaries, see ἵ

the very interesting preface, prefixed by Mr. Ellis to the Tract De Fluxu
et Refluxu Maris, Bacon's Worlrs, vol. iii. pp. 39—46. ι

To this Preface and to some good account of the theory and phe·
nomena of the tides, such as may be found iu the Encyclopaedia Bri-
tannica or Encyclopaedia Metropolitana, the student must be, once for all,
referred for further information ou this subject. lt would be a waste of
labour to attempt here to criticise or correct Bacon’s remarks in detail. lt
may be sufficient to state generally that he confounds throughout currenss
and derivative tides with tides proper.

lilith what Bacou says on the tides in this Aphurism, we should compare ,

the passage in Aph. 35, aud also that on the pheuomena of spring and
· neap tides in Aph. 45, referred to in note 7² above. seealsomynotesou
both these passages.
