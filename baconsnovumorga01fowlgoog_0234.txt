ΠΒ. Ι. 41-42. 211

oannes perceptiones, tam sensus quam mentis, sunt ex
analogia hominis, non ex analogia universi ⁵⁰. Estque in·
tellectus humanus instar speculi inaequalis ad radios rerum,

qui suam naturam naturae rerum immiscet, eamque distorquet

et inficit.
XLII.

· Idola specus ⁵¹ sunt idola hominis individui. Habet enim
unusquisque (praeter aberrationes naturae humanae in
genere) specum sive cavernam quandam individuam, quae
lumen naturae frangit et corrumpit: vel propter naturam

subsequent operation of the intellect upon the materials supplied by them,
seems too crude a theory to have ever been seriously entemained except in
the infancy 01 speculation. tt is an entirely different position to assert that
the perceptione of the senses are an essential condition of knowledge, asie
done by Locke, by Kant, and, in fact, by Aristotle, and as appears to
be implied throughout by Bacon himself.

⁶⁰ The word Analogy is used here, as in hph. 34, in its more general
sense of ‘relation’ and not in either its earlier or later technical sense,
as employed in Logic. For these, the student may refer to the Editor’s
works on Deductive Logic, pt. iii. ch. i. n. a, and on Inductive Logic,ch. 4.

lt is the central thought 01 the Baconian philosophy that we must lay
ourselves, as it were, alongside 01 nature, and study the facts of the
external world, instead of commencing with our own thoughts, 000 pro·
jecting these, as it were, on the universe. Man must look without and not
within, if he desires to be truly acquainted with the world around him.
This idea is perfectly just, providing we recollect that, after all, we 000
never know things as they are in themselves, but only as they appear
to us. The peculiarities 01 tbe human mind generally and of the indi·
110001 10100 10 particular must, after all our precautions, have their share
in determining the form which our knowledge assumes. By what is true,
we mean, in the last analysis, that which 011 men might be brought to
acknowledge, 11 their faculties were 10 0 healthy and vigorous condition,
01011 they were supplied with all the materials requisite for forming
ajudgment.

Malebranche (11001010000010116010,11110 ii. 2²²⁰ partie, ch. n) refers
to these words and the next sentence as ‘fort judicieuses’

⁶¹ The 10010011οβ is taken from Plato’s Mythe of the Cave, at the
opening 01 the 7th Book 01 the Republic. But, as is remarked by Sir
W. Hamilton (Reid's Works, p. 473, 0.), the metaphor applies rather 10 the
idola Tribus than to the class 01 fallacies here described; for by Plato 011
mankind, except the few philosophers who have found their way upwards,
are regarded as being bound in the same cave, and as mistaking the shadows
which pass before them for realities. By Bacon, 00 the other hand, each
man is pictured as dwelling in his own particular cave, 000 mistaking his
individua] impressions for those of mankind at large.
