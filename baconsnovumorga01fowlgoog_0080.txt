can ascertain, are independent and underived. The latter are what
may be called the essential attributes, and, taken together, constitute,
in the most intelligible sense which can be attached to that word, the
essem os the substance, class, or quality³⁶. When we attempt to express
the essence in words, we enumerate the essential qualities‚ or construet
its definaie’on. But the importantur characteristic part of the delinition
is the differentia ,⁶ for the genus may be regarded as already known
before we begin to detine, our object being to discover the differentia
or differentiae which distinguish the term defined from certain other
terms which fall under the same genus. We see, then, how, from the
conception of the aggregate oi independent and underived (or, as we
might call them,pr1inary) attributes, we are able to explain alilre the
expressions oi essence, definition, and differentia, whether applied to
a class (as, say, man or horse), or to what is ordinarily called a sub·
stance (as, say, gold), orto a quality (as, say, heat). It is only to the
last oi these, however, namely quahties or ‘simple natures,’ that Bacon
regarded his method as, at least immediately, applicable.

Coming to the second class of passages, in which the conception of
‘law’ predominates, we lind that they are founded on the scholastic,
or rather Aristotelian, distinction of potentia and actus, δύναμις and
ἐνέργεια. As this distinction is explained in the notes on i. 51, 1 may
refer the reader, who is not aheady acquainted with it, to that place.
The ‘form' is ‘lex actus sive motus,' ‘lex illa et determinatio actus
puri quae naturam aliquam simplicem ordinat et constituit in omni·
moda materia et subjecto susceptibili! The ‘form’ then, according
to this mode oi representing it, is the law which governs (or, as we
should rather say, expresses) the process by which a quality (or body)
is dev'eloped out os its pre-existing conditions. It may be defined as
the law oi the development or manifestation or productiori of any
given quality or body. (Cp. Nov. Org. 11. 25 ad init.) And, if we
take into account the pre-existing conditions as well as the law oi
their development, we obtain the conception of‘cause' in its fullest
extent We thus see how the word ‘form’ may be replaced by ‘law'
or ‘cause'

Now, is it possible to reconcile or bring into any connection these
two apparently divergent ‘meaningsi The form, we have seen, is,
according to the one conception, the aggregate oi the primary or
underived attributes hom which the other attributes are derived, as
