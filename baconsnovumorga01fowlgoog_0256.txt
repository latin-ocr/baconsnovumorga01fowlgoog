LIB. l. 61. 233

At idola theatri innata non sunt, nec occulto insinuata in
intellectum 10; sed ex fabulis theoriarum, et perversis legibus
demonstrationum, plane indita et recepta. In his autem
confutationes tentare et suscipere consentaneum prorsus non
, est illis,quaeanobis dicta sunt. Quum enim nec de princi·
piis consentiamus, nec de demonstrationibus, tollitur omnis
argumentatio. Id vero bono fit fato, ut antiquis suus constet
h0n0s11. Nihil enim illis detrahitur, quum de via omnino
quaestio sit. Claudus enim (ut dicitur) in via antevertit
cursorem extra viam. Etiam illud manifesto liquet, currenti
extra viam, quo habilior sit et velocior, eo majorem contingere
aberrationem.

Nostra vero inveniendi scientias ea est ratio, ut non multum
ingeniorum acumini et robori relinquatur; sed quae ingenia
et intellectus fere exaequet ¹². Quemadmodum enim ad hoc

²⁰ The words ‘insinuata in intellectum’ apply to the ldola F ori. For
the various divisions of the ldola given in the different works of Bacou,
see notes on Aphs. 38, 39. We have here a trace of the old division into
‘innata,' including the ldola Tribus and ldola Specus, and ‘adscititia‚’
which were co-extensive with the ldola Theatri. Cp. pp. 170, 1⁷¹·
The ldola Fori, as falling under neither division, created a difficulty,
and seem here to be regarded as intermediate between the two.

The two divisions of the ldola Theatri, namely, those arising from
false systems of philosophy and those arising from perverse laws of
demonstrati0n‚ are sometimes treated by Bacon, as, for instance, in the
Distributio Operis, as if they were distinct classes of Idola. Corresponding
to them, he proposes to fumish in the Novum Orgauum a ‘Redargutio

Philosophiarum' anda ‘Redargutio Demonstrationum.’ But these ‘ Redar-
gutiones,’ it will be found, are not kept altogetherdistinct in the Aphorisms

which follow. To the remaining ‘Idola’ corresponds the ‘Redargutio “

Rationis humanae nativae! Cp. p. 171.

¹¹ ln this and similar passages, which abound throughout the Novum
Organum, it is impossible not to detect an air of contemptuous superiority.
‘Why should 1 contend with the ancients for the palm of genius, when
it is enough for me that l am on the right road, and they on the wrong
one. Let them run as fast as they like. They will ouly run the further
from the truth'

¹¹ Commenting on this passage, Macaulay (Essay on Bacou) says: ‘This
really seems to us as extravagant as it would have been in Lindley Murray
to announce that every body who should leam his Grammar would write
as good English as Dryden‚ or in that very able writer, the Archbishop
of Dublin, to promise that all the readers of his Logic would reason like
Chillingworth, aud that all the readers of his Rhetoric would speak like
