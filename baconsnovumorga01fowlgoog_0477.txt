esset ad centrum ⁵⁸. Esset enim certe virtuosum plane et
efficax genus nihili, aut puncti mathematici, quod aut alia
afficeret, aut rursus quod alia appeterent ⁵⁹: corpus enim non
nisi a corpore patitur. Verum iste appetitus ascendendi et
descendendi aut est in schematismo corporis quod movetur,
aut in sympathia sive consensu cum alio corpore⁶⁰. Quod
si inveniatur aliquod corpus densum et solidum, quod nihil-
ominus non feratur ad terram⁶1, confunditur hujusmodi divisio.
At si recipiatur opinio Gilberti⁶², quod magnetica vis terrae

⁵⁸ While men remained ignorant of the laws of accelerating lorceS, this
consequence was a necessary inference from the Peripatetic doctrine that
heavy bodies tend downwards. lt would also follow from the thesis pro·
pounded by Gilbert: ‘Centrum Virtutum magneticarum in tellure, est
telluris centrum! De Magnete, lib. ii. cap. 27.

The true account is that, if a tube were bored through the centre ol the
earth, abody would oscillate between the point on the sursace or within
the tube from which it was dropped and the corresponding point on the
opposite surlace or within the opposite part of the tube; and, if there
were no resisting medium, this oscillation would go on lor ever. See
Price’s Inlinltesimal Calculus, vol. iii. ᾗ 233. The theorem is there proved
of a homogeneous sphere, but, though the earth is not hornogeneous,
heterogeneity on one side oi the centre is approximately balanced by
corresponding heterogeneity on the otber, and hence the conclusionis
approximately true. Talcing into account, however, the influence ola
resisting medium, the body would, alter an enormous number of oscilla·
tions, ultimately rest at the centre.

Galileo states this case, and resolves it rightly. See Dialogo dei Massimi
Sistemi, Giomata Seconda„Florence Ed. ol 1842, vol. i. pp. 251-2 (Sir
Thomas Salusbury’s Translation‚ pp. θος-4).

³⁹ The sentence is ironical. ‘F or it would certainly be a very powerful
and efficacious lind ol nothing, or mathematical point, which could either
affect other things, or again which other things might seek.’

lt seems strange that Bacon did not perceive that tbe position which he
criticises would be quite in accordance with any interpretation which could
be put on the ‘sympathia sive cousensus' of which he speaks below, and
that it would be no real exception to the rule ‘corpus non nisi a corpore
patitur!

⁰⁰ Cp. Aph. 3⁶ (3) and notes. lt will be noticed that the words ‘iste
appetitus ascendendi et descendendi ' imply the notion of positive levity.

⁶¹ lt is curious here to notice how far Bacon was lrom seeing that the
moon was exactly a case in point, or from divining the true boud ol
connection (‘ foederis sive unionis ⁹) between its revolution round the earth
and the phenomeua ol falling bodies.

⁶² See De Magnete, libii. cap. 7. Tbe expression ‘orbis virtutis: as
applied both to the earth and to ordinary magnets, is common throughout
