LJB. Ι. 80. 269

summa ingenia illis temporibus ut plurimum ad res civiles se
applicuerunt, propter magnitudinem imperii Romani, quod
plurimorum hominum opera indigebat. At illa aetas qua
naturalis philosophia apud Graecos maxime llorere visa est,
particula fuit temporis minime diutuma3 cum et antiquioribus
temporibus septem illi, qui sapientes nominabantur, omnes
(praeter Thaletem) ad moralem philosophiam et civilia se

’ applicuerint3 et posterioribus temporibus postquam Socrates

philosophiam de coelo in terras deduxisset ¹⁹, adhuc magis

invaluerit moralis philosophia, et ingenia hominum a naturali
averterit.

At ipsissima illa periodus temporis, in qua inquisitiones de
natura²⁰ viguerunt, contradictionibus et novorum placitorum
ambitione corrupta est, et inutilis reddita. Itaque quando-
quidem per tres istas periodos naturalis philosophia majorem
in modum neglecta aut impedita fuerit, nil mirum si homines
parum in ea re profecerint, curn omnino aliud egerint.

Accedit et illud, quod naturalis philosophia in iis ipsis viris,

life (witness the discussions in the so-called ‘Metaphysics’ of Aristotle),
Ι and, consequently, possessed no attractions for ordinary men. The belief
‚ or disbelief in the propositions propounded was not regarded as likely to
affect a man's lot either in this world or the next. The tendency of
speculation, therefore, both among the later Greeks and the Romans,
was towards a philosophy of life, character, and conduct, and this tendency
amongst the Romans was specially assisted by the legal and practical
directiou of their minds. The favourite topics of discussion were not
the nature of the Gods or our relations to them, much less our duties
towards them, but our relations and duties to each other, the main objects
of life, wherein consists the perfectiori of human nature, by what means
we can attain that perfectiori, and other questions of asimilar character.
lt was the answer to these questions, we might say, and not the answer
to theological enquiries, which furnisbed the spiritual sustenance of the
Greeks and Romans. Hence, Bacon's remark that moral philosophy, ln
classical times, supplied the place of theology, if not accurately, is at least
approximately true.
¹⁸ See Cicero’s Tusculan Disputations, bk. v. ch. 4: ‘Socrates autem
primus philosophiam devocavit e coelo, etin urbibus collocavit, et in domos
etiam introduxit, et coegit devita, et moribus, rebusque bonis et malis
quaerere! Cp. Academics, i. 4.
¹⁰ ln this concluding paragraph, Bacon seems to employ the phrase
Natural Philosophy in the same sense as in the De Augmentis.
