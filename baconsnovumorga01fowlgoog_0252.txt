At zilolafori omnium molestissima sunt; quae ex loedere
verborum et nominum⁹⁶ se insinuarunt in intellectum. Cre·
dunt enim homines, rationem suam verbis imperare. Sed fit
etiam ut verba vim suam super intellectum retorqueant et
reflectant; quod philosophiam et scientias reddidit sophisticas
et inactivus. Verba autem plerunque ex captu vulgi induntur,
atque per lineas vulgari intellectui maxime conspicuas res
secant ⁹⁷. Quum autem intellectus acutior, aut observatio
diligentior, eas lineas transferre velit, ut illae sint magis
secundum naturam3 verba obstrepunt. Unde fit, ut magnae
et solennes disputationes hominum doctorum saepe in contro-
versias circa verba et nomina desinant ⁹⁸3 a quibus (ex more
et prudentia mathematicorum) incipere consultius foret, easque
per definitiones in ordinem redigere. Quae tamen defini·
tiones, in naturalibus et materiatis, huic malo mederi non
possunt 99; quoniam et ipsae definitiones ex verbis constant,

⁹⁷ Cp. Cogitata et Visa, E. and 8., νοΙ. iii. p. 599. It sometimes happens
that aword only partly expresses the conception which we wish to
convey; sometimes it expresses more. There is a similar desect in the
distinctions which we attempt to express by two or more contrasted words,
such as organic and inorganic‚ animal and vegetable, rational and irra-
tional, virtue and vice, science and art, and the like. These require con-
stant rectification and definitiou‚ in order to make them express exactly
what we wish to express and no more. Words, as Bacon says, are inherited
from vulgar use, aud hence there is osten the greatest difficulty in attaching
to them any precise, scientIfic sense, nor, even when this is done, will men
always agree to accept or employ them in the sense thus attached to them.

⁹⁸ We need only instance such words as idea, sense, cause, reason,
substance, etc, in mental philosophy, and cause, force, form, essence, motion,
etc., in physical philosophy. The truth of this remark as applied to the
questions agitated in morah, politics, and theology will be familiar to
every student.

⁹⁰ considerable confusion has arisen ln the discussion ol questions
relating to scientific method from not observing that Definitions are of
a very different character and occupy a very different position in the
moral and physical sciences, on the one haud, and in the mathematica}
sciences, on the other. In Mathematics, the inductions by which we gain
the most fundamental truths with respect to space and number are
