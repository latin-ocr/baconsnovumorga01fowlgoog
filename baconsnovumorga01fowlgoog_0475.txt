⁶³ Bacon is alluding to the Trade-Winds, which, when not interfered
with by local causes, blow, speaking roughly, from east to west. On the
causes oi these winds, see Herschel's Outlinesos Astronomy‚ ᾗ a 39 (4th En),
or Tyndall's Heata Mode oi Motion, § 206, dcc. (3rd Ed), or almost any
manual oi Physical Geography.

The ‘circuli rotationis‚’ of which Bacon speaks, must be those os the
winds, or of the heavens; for, in the Tractate de Fluxu et Refluxu Maris
(E. and S., vol. iii. p. 53), he speaks of the theory of the earth’s rotation as
‘satis licenter excogitatum, quoad rationes physicas,¹ language which is in
accordance with what he invariably says elsewhere, when the question is
definitely before him. See Introduction, pp. 34, 35, and my notes there
referred to.

Μ Bacon, of course, was ignorant of the true theory of the tides, nameiy,
that they are caused by the attraction of the sun and moon, heaping up, as
it were, the waters nearest to them, as well as those most remote from
them. His own theory seems to have been that the waters, under the
iniluence of the sun, move naturally from east to west, but that they are
driven back by striking on the coasts of America. See his Tractare de
Fluxu et Refluxu Maris, and the Introduction to it by Mr. Ellis (E. and S.,
vol. iii. p. 39, δια). This idea was probably suggested by the Gulf Stream,
which, under the iniluence of the Trade-Winds, florus, in the early part
of its course, westwards, from the coast of Africa to that oi America

ω Bacon, we must recollect, was ignorant oi the true explanation of the
phenomena which we designate ‘light’ and ‘heavy.’
