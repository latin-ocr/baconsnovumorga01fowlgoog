very confident os the conclusions which they had embraced. More
or less oi hesitation as between the two theon'es, or rather as between
the various theorias, was, perhaps, the commonest state of mind
among those who were qnalified to give any opinion ⁸¹, and this
sometimes appears to have been the case, even with Bacon himself,
though never to the extent, I believe, ol actually altering the con-
clusions which he had formed on the subject in early lise.

As to the tone in which Bacon treats this question, I cannot but
think that most readers have been led to conceive an undue prejudiee
against him by the ill-considered statement of Hume, that ‘he re-
jected, with the most positive disdain, the system os Copemicus⁸¹.'
Thathe consistently reJected the system os Copernicus throughout lite,
whether as to the annual or as to the diurnal motion, Ι certainly believe,
as I have pointed out in my notes⁸³ 3 but, il we except a passage in
his juvenile performance, the Praise ol Knowledge, where he speaks
ol ‘these new carmen who drive the earth about⁸⁴,’ and another in the
Temporis Partus Masculus ⁸⁸, where, as 1 have so olten said, he
purposely states hls views in an exaggerated fonn‚I do not thinlr
that the tone in which he speaks os the Copernican theory can at
all lairly be described as that os ‘positive disdain.' Thus, in Nov.
Org. ii. 35, his language is, ‘At motus ille perennis rotationis,
videtur esse coelestium proprius ; statio, sive quies, videtur competere
globo ipsi terrae ⁸⁶! ln ii. 3⁶ (a), he proposes the alternative between
the diurnal motion ol the earth and that os the heavens as a subject
ol serious enquiry, to which an ‘instantia crucis’ may be applied,
though 1 think there is no doubt as to the side to which he himself
leans. ln ii. 46, speaking ol the enormous velocity which must be
ascribed to the heavens on the ordinary theory, he says with the
