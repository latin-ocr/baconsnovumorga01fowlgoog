ln constituendo autem axiomate, forma inductionis alia
quam adhuc in usu luit excogitanda est; enque non ad
principia tantum (quae vocant) probanda et invenienda, sed
etiamad axiomata minora et media, denique omnia. Inductio

have too fertile an imagination, but his imaginative powers should be com·
bined with a lreen perception oi the requirements of evidence and with
corresponding critical acumen. Bacon has really hit the mark in Aph. 57.

⁹⁴ On the Inductio per Enumerationem simplicem, and the distinction
between it and Scientific lnductlon (⁸ quae ad inventionem et demonstra-
tionem scientiarum et artium est utilis')‚ see my lnductive Logic, 3rd ed.,
pp. 7-9, ran-124, 214-221‚ ²74·293- ln reading these passages, the student
must distinguisb between the legitimate and illegitimate, as well as between
the necessary and unnecessary, employment of the Inductio per Enumera-
tionem simplicem.

’ὅ That is, on no certain grounds.

⁹⁶ A single contradictory instance is generally sufficient to overthrow an
induction based on simple enumeration, but, where an induction isbased on
elimination and seems to establish a causal connection, the strong pre·
sumption is that any exception is apparent only and is really due to some
counteracting cause. Cp. Cogitata et Visa (E. and S., vol. iii. p. orm:
‘Visum est ei, talem inductionis sormam inveniendam, quae ex aliquibus
generaliter concludat; ita ut instantiam contradictoriam inveniri non posse
demonstretur.'

’Ἰ Thus, a man living in one part of the globe might infer from the men
whom he had seen that all men are white,a man living in another part that
all men are black, and so on.

⁰⁸ This is Scientific Induction, as distinguished from Inductio per Enu-
merationem simplicem. But, though Bacon had iormed the idea oia
Scientilic Induction, or a process of elimination by means of which causes
might be detected, bis own account of the process arrd of the rules by
which it should be conducted is vague and not sufficiently adapted to
practice. Subsequent writers, especially Sir John Herschel, Dr. Whewell, '
and Mr. Mill, bave rendered these rules at once more precise and better
adapted to practice. See notes on Bk. ii. Aple. 11-18‚ and Introduction,
