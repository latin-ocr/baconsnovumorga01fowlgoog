28 INTRODUCTION.

claim more than a general acquaintance with the special branches
of science.

It is less excusable, whether we put it⁸down to lack of curiosity, to
personaljealousy, or to wantos sufficient appreciation of its import-
ance, that Bacon makes no mention of Harveys great discovery of
the Circulation of the Blood. As Harvey began to teach this doctrine
in1619, and aa he was court-physician to James 1, it is difficult to
suppose that Bacon had heard nothing of it⁶⁷.

Tkough the true theory of the Motiou of Projectiles had not been
distinctly stated till the publication of Galileo’s Dialogues on Motion
in 1638, still the speculatione of Tartalea, Digges, tac, ought, if they
had been known to Bacon, to have saved him from shewing such
complete ignorance, when treating of the subject, as he exhibita in
Nov. Org. il. 3⁶ (6), ii. 48 ad fin, and other places ⁵⁸. It is curicus
that one of the books (the Pantometria, published in 1591), in which
Digges speaks of the compound motion of a projectile‚ was dedicated
to Bacon’s father.

Notwithstanding his frequent criticisms of the Peripatetic doctrine
of Motion, it is plain that Bacon entertained no doubt of the ‘latio
gravium versus terram, et levium versus ambitum coeli ³⁹‚’ or of the
existence of bodies having positive levity. In fact, in Nov. Org. ii. 35,
he repeats‚ in almost the precise words of Aristotle himself, the Aristo·
telian division of what is called ‘motion of translation' (φορά), and
'sums up his account with the words ‘Atque ista pulchra dictu sunt'
And though, with respect to the circular and eternal motion of'the
heavcnly bodies, he impugna Aristotle’s theory in the Descriptio
Globi Intellectualis‘⁰‚ Ι am not avare of any passage in which it
appears to occur to him that the received division of light and heavy,
and the two kinds of motion founded thereon, may be without

Bucon. See some curicus passages in his Works, vol. ii. pp. 515, 5163 voliii. p. 621
(ed. of 1744). In the former passage, he seems to entertain no kind of doubt that
he has produced silver out of gold, ‘or at least a new kind of metal very different
from gold? Thea, he concludes generally ‘that there may be a real transmutation
of one metal into another, even among the perfectest and noblest metals, and that
eflected by factitious agents iu a short time, and, if l may so speak, altera mecha·
nical manner)

· ’Τ ln the Historia Densi et Rari, and in the very part which was probably written
during Bacon's last ‘quinquennium' he thinks it a sufficient account of pulsation in
the beart and arterias of animala, to say that it is due to the endless aud alternate
dilatation and contraction of the spirits See E. and S., vol. ii. p. 263.
