LIB. Ι. 63. 237

majores et minores dimensiones sive spatia, per frigidam dis-
tinctionem actus et potentiae transegerit 21; motum singulis
corporibus unicum et proprium, et, si participent ex alio
motu, id aliunde moveri, asseruerit ²²: et innumera alia, pro

lig'ble, and, bearing in mind the account, given in note 86 on Aph. 51, of
the technical terms ἐνέργεια and ἐντελέχεια, this may easily be supplied.

The lifeless body, as, for instance, the embryo, may be regarded as capable
of lif. lt attains its actuality,assoon as it begins to live. Thus, ψυχή is
the actual manifestation (ἐντελέχεια) of that life which every organized
body has potentially. But why ἡ πρώτη.ἐ We must recollect that δύναμιν
and ἐνέργεια οι ἐντελέχεια are purely relative tenns; what is a δύναμις in oue
relation may be an ἐνέργεια or ἐντελέχεια in another. Now ψυχή, as we
have seen, is the ἐνέργεια οι ἐντελέχεια of σῶμα, but ψυχή, when once
manifested, begins to perform various fonctions (such as, in the case of
man, are perception, thought, διο). These acts or fonctions are them·
selves ἐνέργειαι, of which ψυχή, in its dormant state, may be regarded as
the δυναμέε. Hence, while the manifestations of ψυχὴ are, as it were,
δεντέριιι ἐνέργειαι, ψυχή ilself is a πρώτη ἐνέργεια.

That the technlcal terms of which the definition of ψυχή is composed
represent ‘second intentions’ or ‘second notions' is plain enough. The
student, who is not acquainted with the distinction between ‘first' and
‘second’ notions, should refer to Sir W. Hamilton's Essay on Logic
(Discussions, p. ι 39) or Dr. Mansel’s edition of Aldrich’s Logic, cap. 1. ξ 3.
div. 8, note. lt is possible, however, that Bacon may use the phrase in its
later sense, as employed by Aldrich and others, in which case it is equally
applicable to the terms of the definition criticised.

²¹ Bacon is here probably referring to a passage in the Physics, iv. 5 (6)
[p. 213 a. 1-4]: οὕτω δέ καὶ diyp ἔχει πρὸς ὕδωρ· οἷον ὕλη γάρ, τὸ δ’ εἶδος τὸ
μὲν ὕδωρ ὕλη ἀέρος, d δ’ ἀὴρ οἷον ἐνέργειά τις ἐκείνου· τὸ γέιρ ὕδωρ δυνάμει dv'yp
ἐστιν, ὀ δ’ ἀὴρ δυνάμει ὕδωρ ἄλλον τρόπον. Water is regarded as condensed
air, and air as rarelied water, and, therefore, either may, in a certain

Α sense, be regarded as being the other potentially. ⁴ Actus' and ‘potentia’

of course, correspond respectively with ἐνέργεια and δύναμις.

Mr. Ellis ln his Preface to the Historia Densi et Rari (vol. ii. pp. 236-7)
refers toanother passage in Aristotle (Categ. ch. 8. p. ιο a. 16-24), where
the dense and the rare are explained as due to different modes of the dis-
position of particles, the particles in dense bodies being near one another,
and in rare bodies standing further apart. This is Baeon's own explanation.

²² This is an allusion to the Scholastic distinction of ‘Motus Pro-
prius’ and ‘Motus Alienus! All bodies were supposed to have some one
motion, and one motion only, proper to them. But, in addition to this
motion, they might participate in one or more other motions communicated
to thern by other bodies. Thus, for instance, the wheel of a wateh has
a proper motion of one kind only, but, besides this, it may share in the
motion of the wearer of the¹ watch. And af the wearer of the watch is
sailing on the sea, it participates in no less than three ‘extraneous and
common’ motions, namely the motion of the wearer, the motion of the
