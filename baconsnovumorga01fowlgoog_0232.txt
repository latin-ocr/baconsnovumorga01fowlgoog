Excitatio notionum et axiomatum⁴⁶ per inductionem veram

⁴⁴ Called in Valerius Terminus Idols os the Palace.

⁴⁹⁵ At the beginning ol Aphorism 61, there is a trace oi an old classifica·
tlon ol the ldola into two groups. ln introducing the idola theatri, Bacon
uses the words ‘At stola theatri inuata uon sunt, nec occulto insinuata in
intellectum sed ex sabulis’ dcc. This points to a classilication of the
ldola as innate, including the first three classes, and adventitious, including
the last class or idola theatri only. And this classlfication we lind adopted
in the Distributio Operis. ‘ ldola autem a quibus occupatur mens, vel
Adscititia sunt vel lunata. Adscitltia vero immigrarunt in mentes homi-
num, velex philosophorum placitis et sectis vel ex perversis legibus demon·
strationum. At lunata inhaerent naturae ipsius intellectus, qui ad errorem
longe proclivior esse deprehenditur quam sensus ..... Atque priora illa
duo ldolorum genera aegre, postrema vero baec nullo modo, evelli possunt.
ld tantum relinquitur, ut indicentur, atque ut vis ista mentis insidiatrix
notetur et convincatur ..... ltaque doctrina ista de expurgatione intel-
lectus ut ipse ad veritatem habilis sit, tribus redargutionibus absolvitur:
redargutione philosophiamm, redargutione demonstrationum, et redar-
gutione rationis humanae natiuae! Cp. the Partis Secundae Delineatio
( E. and 8., vol. lii. p. 548), and see Mr. Spedding's remarks in Note C.
to the Prelace to the Novum Organum (vol. i. pp. 113-117), where the
whole question nithe higher classificatiou of the ldola is careiully con-
sidered. This higher classilication oi Adscititia and lunata disappears in
the Novum Organum, because, as ΜΓ. Spedding says, when bacon ‘came
to describe the several ldols oue by one, he became aware both ol the
logical inconsistency of classing the ldola Forl among the lunata, 3ηά
of the practical inconvenience oi classing them among the Adscititla, and
therefore resolved to drop the dichotomy altogether and range them in
four coordinate classes!

⁴⁶ Bacon regarded Induction as requisite both to give cleamess and
precision to our notions 3ηά to establish true propositions which might
serve as the basis ol subsequent reasoning, whether inductive or deduc-
tive. But, as we have already seen (note to Aph. 14), in order to realise
or test the truth or adequacy ol a notion, we must form at least one, and
frequently a number oijudgments. When we employ indoctior, therefore,
‘to elicit a notion,’ we necessarily also employ it ‘to elicit an axiom,' and
hence there is no real distinction between the process of induction or
generalisation as applied to notions and as applied to judgments, propo·
sitions, or axioms.
