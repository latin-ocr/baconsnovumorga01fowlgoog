dictasunt intelligimus: atque quemadmodum vulgaris logica,
quae regit res per syllogismum, non tantum ad naturales, sed
ad omnes scientias pertinet; ita et nostra, quae procedit per
inductionem, omnia complectitur. Tam enim historiam et
tabulas ⁵⁰ inveniendi conficimus de ira, metu, et verecundia, et
similibus3 ac etiam de exemplis rerum civilium: nec minus
de motibus mentalibus memoriae, compositionis etdivisionis⁶⁰‚
judicii, et reliquorum, quarn de calido et frigido, aut luce, aut
vegetatione, aut similibus. Sed tamen cum nostra ratio in-
terpretandi, post historiam praeparatam et ordinatam, non
mentis tantum motus et discursus (ut logica vulgaris), sed et

only be attained in these sciences hy the employment, at all events in the
first instance, of the Inductive Method. Speculations, in these as iu all
other subjects, unless based on the patient study of facts, ‘variantur‚ non
augentur! The enormous extension which the method of Induction has
received in recent times by the application of a historical treatment to the
subjects ol law, institutions, language, art, morals, religion, dec, has really
laid the basis of a scientific study of man, which may at some future time
rival iu respect oi certainty, while it will even transcend in interest, the
scientific study of nature. The student who may wish to see successful
examples of this mode of treatment, the historico! method, as it hasbeen
called, is referred to the works of Sir H. Maine, Professor Max Mttller, Sir
J. Lubbock, Mr. Tylor, and (though here, perhaps, he will be treading on
less firm ground) to the Psychology and Sociology of Mr. Herbert Spencer.
For an analysis of the historical method, he may consult the Editor's
Inductive Logic, 3rd ed, pp. ooo-202, and Mill’s Logic, bk. vi. ch. ro.
The whole ol the sixth book of Mr. Mill’s Logic bears on the methods of
the moral aud mental sciences

The word ‘logicis’ in the above sentence should probably he taken as
including what we call ‘psychology’ as well as logie proper. But even
logie, iu the strictest sense of the term, rests ultimately on an inductive
basis. lt is only through having observed what processes of reasoning lead
to a sound, and what to an unsound conclusion, that is, to a conclusion
agreeing or disagreeing with facts, that meu have been able to frame with
any certainty even the rules oi logic itself.

θ’ See last note.

‘⁰ Affirmation and Negation, not, as Mr. Ellis suggests, Synthesis aud
Analysis. See Aldrich’s Logic, ad init: ‘Est enim Judicium aliud Affirma-
rivom, quod vocatur etiarn conpositio ,· aliud Negativum, quod et Divisio!
This termiuology is derived frorn Aristotle. Cp, lor instance, De Inter·
pretatione, ch. l: περὶ γὰρ σύνθεσιν καὶ διαίρεσίν ἐστι τὸ ψεῦδός τε rol τὸ
ἀληθές. τὸ μὲν οὖν ὀνόματα αὐτὸκαὶ τὰ ῥήματα ἔοικε τῷ ἄνευ συνθέσεως καὶ
διαιρέσεως νοήματι, οἷον τὸ ἅνθρωπος ἢ τὸ λευκόν, ὅταν μὴ προστεθῇ τι· οὕτε
γὰρ ψεῦδος οὔτε ἀληθές πω.
