lore, cau hardly be expected to be agreat discoverer. Nor did he
lay claim to any such distinction. His business was, so to speak,
with the philosophy and logie ol sciense, rather than with the body
ol sciense itself3 what he hoped to do, was not so much to advance
sciense in his own person, as to show others how it might be
advanced, and to impel them to the work. That he was successful
in this mission‚ Ι think I have succeeded in showing elsewhere ⁹⁴.
But, il a Dilettante, he was a Dilettante ol no ordinary lrind. The
wealth os illustration exhibited in the Novum Organum and the vast
range ol subjecta reviewed in the De Augmentis shew a width ol
knowledge and an universality ol interest which, notwithstanding all
the delects we have just been enumerating, were probably equalled
in the ease ol no other man then living. What he gained in width,
he, ol course, to a certain extent, lost in depth, lor this is the universal
law ol the human intellect. He was not a Specialist, and, therefore,
can hardly bc said to have left his name in the annals of any particular
branchos science. But, to say nothing of the place which he merita
in the history of Science considered in its tolality, he did, I conceive,
throw out many suggestions ol rare sagacity even in the particular
sciences, and, in a certain sense, anticipate more recent discoveries.
To some ol his more remarkable anticipations ol subsequent views or
discoveries Ι shall now proceed to direct the attention ol the reader.
First ol all, in connection with the subject just discussed at so
much length,1 may mention his sagacious and possibly fertile sug·
gestion oi the necessity ol a closer union between formal and
physical astronomy. ‘Nos nulla cum priorum inventorum jactura,
tamen longe majus opus movemus ; nequeenim calculos aut prae-
dictiones tantum meditamur, sed philosophiam; eam scilicet, quae
de superiorum corpomm non motu solummodo ejusque periodis sed
substantia quoque et omnimoda qualitate, potestate, atque influxu,
intellectum humanum informare, secundum rationes naturales atque
indubitatas absque traditionum superstitione et levitate possit; atque
nusus in motu ipso invenire atque explicare, non quid phoenomenis
sit consentaneum, sed quid in natura penitus repertum atque actu
et reipsa verum sit ⁹⁵! Alittle further on ⁹⁶ he draws a distinction
between the objects ol philosophy and astronomy: ‘De substantia
coelestium inquirit praecipue philosophia, et de causis motus eorum3
