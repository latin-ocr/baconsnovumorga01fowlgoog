vi PREFACE.

antiquarian portions ol the work, would hardly have
been necessary for merely educational purposes. On
the other hand, il l could always have relied on the
cooperation ol a mature student, some ol the refe-
rences and many, perhaps ol the explanations might
have been spared. But, as a rule, l think, the results
aimed at by the two objects have pretty nearly
coincided, and l have 'thought it, at least, safer
to err on the side of offering too much elucidation
rather than too little.

The position of Bacon mid-way, as it were, between
Scholasticism‚ on one side, and Modern Philosophy
and Science, on the other, is so interesting that l
cannot but think that much has even still to be learnt
from the study of his works, and especially os this,
the chief and most influential ol them all. Not
only is the Novum Organum a collection ol fine
sayings and suggestive remarks, but a knowledge ol
it is indispensable to the student os the History either
ol Logic, of Philosophy, or ol the Physical Sciences.
Moreover, it lurnishes an excellent starting-point in the
history os anylof these subjects, whether we wish
to go backwards or sorwards. But this very lact
renders it essential that it should be accompanied
with a copious commentary, both to point out the
objects ol interest, and to institute comparisons with
what the reader has seen or will see elsewhere. Nor
is the interest ol the work simply historical. As l
have pointed out in the section ol the Introduction
devoted to that subject, its present value to the student
os philosophy or logic is also, Ι believe, by no means
inconsiderable.
