540 NOVUM ORGANUM.

(11) Sit Motus Undecimus, Motus assimilatum, sive
Multiplicationis sui, sive etiam Gemrotionis Simplicis. Gene-
rationem autem simplicem dicimus non corporum integralium,
ut in plantis, aut animalibus; sed corpomm similarium¹³.
Nempe per hunc motum corpora similaria vertunt corpora
alia affinia, aut saltem bene disposita et praeparata, in sub-
stantiam et naturam suam: ut flamma, quae super halitus
et oleosa multiplicat se, et generat novam flammam 14; ae'r,
qui superaquam et aquea multiplicat se, et generat novum
aerem ¹⁶3 spiritus vegetabilis et animalis, qui super tenuiores

¹⁸ This is a cunous limitation. The subject proposed for euquiry is not

the process by which the lile oi the whole animal or plant is sustained, but i

the process by which and the materials out ol which the separate parts (as

the bone, muscles, flesh, dte.) are repaired or augmented. Bacon’s ignor- .

ance of organic chemistry renders the discussion almost worthless.
¹⁴ On the physical constitution of flame, and the means by which it is

sustained or augmented (on which points Bacon was, oi course, ignorant), ’

see Tyndall's Heat a Mode of Molion, and Ed, § 49, &c., or Watts'
Dictionary os Chemistry, article ‘Combustion,' already referred to in the
note on ii. 36 ad fin. Cp. also the whole oi the passage on F lame in
ii. 36 (8), with the notes upon it.

¹³ The transmutability of the Elements was one of the leading doctrines
of the Peripatetic school. The student will find a clear and succinet
statement of the theory in Arist. De Gen. et Corr. ii. 4 (p. 331). The

. conversion of water into air requires only the change of one quality,

namely of ‘cold’ into ‘warm,' the ‘moist' being already common to the
two. The intimate relation between air and water is spoken oi in a

variety oi ways. Thus in Phys. iv. 5 (p. ²13 a. 1-4), Aristotle says sm ¹

a passage already quoted) : οὕτω δὲ καὶ tiiyp ἔχει πρὸς ὕδωρ· οἶον ὕλη γάρ, rd
di eidos, τὸ μὲν ὕδωρ ὕλη dipos, ό di ἀὴρ oiov ἐνέργειά τις ἐκείνου· τὸ γὰρ &dep
δυνάμει ἇὴρ durinci δ’ ἀὴρ δυνάμει ὕδωρ ἄλλον τρόπον. See also a cufious

discussion in Meteorologica, i. 3 (339 a-341 a). Seneca (Nat. Qsaest. 2

iii. ro) has a striking passage on the constant interchange ol the elements.

Patricius, who attacks the doctrine os the transmutability oi the elements
(Discuss. Peripatet. tom. iv. lib. 3. pp. 395-6), aslis very pertinently, who
ever saw air converted into water, or water into air. ‘Dicat mihi de
numero istorum philosophorum aliquis, an unquam viderint, observarint,
aerem in aquam converti? Scio ego, vidi, concedam, ex aqua et terra
in adrem vapores ascendere, aerem eos fieri nemo unquam vidit*¹ ⁴¹ * ⁸ ⁸ *
At dixit [Aristoteles] aerem in aquam transmutari. Scio eum dixisse, sed
experimentum cur non attulit? Adferant sui pro eo.’

Bacon's idea seems to have been that air renews itself, and feeds, as
