122 INTRODUCTION.

truths. For hypotheses are not to be regarded in Experimental
Philosophy. And although the arguing from experimenta aud ob·
servations by induction be no demonstration ol general conclusions ;
yet itis the best way ol arguing which the nature ol things admits os,
and may be looked upon as so much the stronger, by how much the
induction is more general. And if no exception occur from phae-
nomena, the conclusion may be pronounced generally. But it at any
time afterwards any exception shall occur srorn experiments3 it may
then begin to be pronounced, with such exceptions as occur. By
this way ol analysis we may proceed lrorn compounds to ingredi·
ents; and lrom motions to the sorces producing them; and, in
general, from effects to their causes; and from particular causes
to more general ones, till the argument end in the most general.
This is the method ol Analysis. And the Synthesis consists in
assuming the causes discovered, and established as principles, and by
thern explaining the phaenomena proceeding from them, and proving
the explanations!

This passage, while undoubtedly showing, as it seems to me,
an acquaintance with the Baconian method, is remarkable as denying
to induction the force ol demonstration (a limitation which we may,
perhaps, account lor lrorn Newton's mathematical habit os mind and the
preponderance ol his mathematical pursuits), as well as lor the lact
that it does not appear to recognise any other lorm ol induction than
that ‘per enumerationem simplicem! Both these circumstances
incline me to believe that Newton had not studied‚ or did not
remember, or did not accept the teaching ol the early partos the
Second Book os the Novum Organum, though the precepts and
warnings of the First Book, in their most general form, had produced
a deep impression upon him and had, in great measure, suggested
to him the aims and methods ol his own investigations ³⁶.

How then are we to account for his silence, as respects the name

³⁵ Dr. Hippus, the author ol the Account ol the Novum Organum in the Library
ol Uselul Knowledge (pt. i. p. ro), adopting a remark ol Dugald Stewart (Elementa
Ed. Hamilton, vol. ii. p. a 36), adduces Newton's application οἰ the word ‘axiam'
to the Laws ol Motion and the higher generalisations ol Optics‚ as a prool'
of the influence exerclsed on him by Bacon's logical phraseology. This argument
may have some weight, but. as l shall point out in a note on Bk.i. Aph. 7, Newton
does not use the word ‘axiom’ with so much latitude as does Bacon, and, more·
over, in the manuals ol logie which he probably read as a young man, so sar l'rom
finding the word restricted, as at present, to sels-evident propositions in mathc-
matics. he would find it used as the equivalent ol Proposition ln general.
