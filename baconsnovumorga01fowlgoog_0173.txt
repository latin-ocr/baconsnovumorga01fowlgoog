work has also been recently re-published, with considerable exten·
sions and under a new title: Francis Bacon und Seine Nachfolger;
Entwicklungsgeschichte der Erfahrungsphilosophie. Leipzig, 1875.
[This work is of great importance in the study of the Baconian
philosophy, and of peculiar interest as containing so favourable au
estimate of Bacon from a foreign writer, belonging himself to a very
different school of thought]

Bacon. Sa Vie‚ Son Temps‚ Sa Philosophia, et Son Influence
jusqu'a nos jours par Charles de Remusat. Paris, 1857. [This work,
like the last, should be diligently pemsed by every student of Bacon.
M. de Remusat attempts especially to bring out an ideal side in the
Baconian philosophy]

The magnificent edition of Bacon’s works by Ellis, Spedding, and
Heath. The rst vol, containing the Novum Organum and De
Augmentis, appeared in 1857. No student of Bacon's philosophy
can now dispense with the five volumes, containing the Philosophical
Works with prelaces and notes, to which such frequent reference is
made in the subsequent pages of this edition.

Ueber Baco’s von Verulam wissenschaftliche Principien von h.
Lasson. Berlin, 1860. [This short tract is, to my mind, the most
effective of all the attacks on the Baconian philosophy. It must,
l think, have suggested to Liebig the onslaught which he made three
years subsequently, but it is far more moderate and elevated in tone
than is his diatribe, and shews a far more intimate acquaintance both
with Bacon’s doctrines and with the history of philosophy in
general]

Ueber Francis Bacon von Verulam und die Methode der Natur-
forschung, von Justus von Liebig. llltlnchen, 1863. [This disquisition
is written in a tone of shrill invective, almost as if Bacon were a
personal enemy of the writer. Liebig was himself so well satisfied
with his performance‚ that he published it also in an English form,
in Macmillan's Magazine (July and August, 1863). It hasbeen
translated into French, and published with some notes and addi·
lions, by Μ. De Tchihatchef, PariS, 1866 (2⁸¹0 Ed, 1877).]

A large part of Franchi's Letture su la Storia della Filosofia
blodema lllilano, 1863, is devoted to Bacon. [The estimate of him
as a reformer of method and science is, on the whole, unfavourable.]

Liebig’s work produced a lively controversy in Germany. He was
answered by Heinrich Bdhmer, in a work entitled Ueber Francis
Bacon von Verulam,· &c.‚ Erlangen‚ 1864 3 and also by Sigwart
of Titbingen. Sigwart attached Liebig’s work ln the Preussische
