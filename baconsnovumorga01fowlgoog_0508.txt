³⁹ On these various discoveries, the last of which was also claimed by the
monh Scheiner, see Delambre, Histoire del'Astronomie Moderne, tomei. =
liv. vi, and Mr. Drinlrwater's Life of Galileo‚ printed ln the Library of
Useful Knowledge‚ above referred to.

⁴⁰ Galileo’s discoveries were often represented as mere optieal delusione.
The following amusing story is told of Scheiner (Baden Powell's History
of Natural Philosophy, p. 171) : ‘Scheiner wasa monk3 and, on communi·
cating to the superior of his order the account of the spots, received in
reply from that learned father a solemn admonition against such heretical
notioris: “l have searched through Aristotle,” he said, “and can find
nothing of the kind mentioned: be assured, therefore, that it is a decep·
tion of your senses, or of your glasses.”’ One Lodovico delle Colombe
maintained that the apparently hollow parts of the moon were filled
with pure transparent crystal„ to which Galileo replied that he would
gladly admit the theory, provided that, with equal courtesy, he was
allowed to raise on the smooth sursace crystal mountains ten times higher
than those which he had ever seen and measured.

⁴¹ These were astronomica] instruments, used for the purpose of ‘taking’
or observing the stars. ‘The ancient astrolabe consisted of two or more
circles, havinga common centre, and so inclined to each other as to enable
the astronomer to observe in the planes of different circles of the sphere at
the same time. For example, if the* circles were at right angles, the
instrument would give both longitude and latitude, or the right ascension
and declination of astar. The equatorial‚ the altitude and azimuth in·
strument, and the theodollte, are instrumenis which answer the same
purpose as the ancient astrolabe! Brande and Cox’s Dictionary of
Seleuco, dte. The term astrolabe is also employed to denote a plaui-

sphera.
