⁸⁸ Mr. Kitchin has the following interesting note on this passage: ‘The
questions started here and in the nent paragraph have been settled3 and
the result is such as proves the similarity in kind of Solar and other Heat;
so that in these places no Negative can be adduced. Large lenses brought
before lighted candles or the lire produce sensible Heat; and by collecting
the rays of Heat in the atmosphere, even when the Sun is quite hidden
behind clouds, concave Mirrors produce a definite increase of Heat at
their focus. Farther than this, MM. Saussure and Pictet of Genera have
established the truth as to “ferrum vel lapis calefactus, sed non ignitus‚''
&e by heating an iron ball so as not to be luminous, and by experimenting
on boiling water. From the results they have shewn that Heat emanates
iu invisible rays, and is subject to the same laws of reflection, dcc. as if it
were accompanied by rays of light as well. Melloir has also established
the fact that Heat is refrangible; and (like Light of different colours) Heat
from different sources has different degrees of refrangibility. Forbes has
established the polarisation of Heat from both luminous and nou-luminous
sources: he also depolarised Heat; and as this is a consequence solely
of double refraction, he thereby has proved that Heat is subject also
to the Laws of double refraction. See Tumer's Chemistry, Heat, pp.
14-2o.’

‘Mersenne says the greater number of the experiments mentioned in
the second book of the Novum organum had already been made, and
mentions particularly, as if he had himself tried it, the reflexion of all kinds
oi heat by a burning mirror. He also asserts that light is always accom-
panied by beat. De la Verite des Sciences (πόα 5), p. πο] Mr. Ellis’ note.
In the great majority of cases, 1 think, there is nothing in Bacon's langrrage
to imply that the experiments suggested are original. See Aph. 14.

⁸⁴ lt was a common subject of debate amongst the ancient astronomers
whether Comets were to be regarded as Meteors (which were supposed to
be engendered in the atmosphere), or whether they were more analogous
to the Planets. The point is discussed in a most interesting manner in the
Seventh Book of Seneca's Natural Qrestions. ‘Placet ergo nostris cometas
sieut faces, sicut tubas trabesque et alia ostenta coeli denso aere creari!
He tben argues with great ability against this view, referring to the comets
