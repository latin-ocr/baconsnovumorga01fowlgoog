tr'ones naturae ³⁴ (quia res temeraria estet praematura), at
illam rationem quae debitis modis elicitur a rebus, interpre-

to the earth in times inversely proportional to their weights. But some
bodies, as, r‘or example, dame, do not fall, but rise. This exception was
accounted for by the principle of levity, according to which light bodies
tend upwards. The various current divisione of motion, such as natural
and violent motion, simple and'compound motion, and the like, easily lent
themselves to frivolous distinctions of this lrind.

The desire to patch up a theory by ingenious devices rather than to
review and emend it is well illustrated hythe various contrivances oi
epicycles and eccentrics by which the ancient astronomers endeavoured
to retain, in spite of all difficulties, the theory of the circular motion
ol the heavenly bodies. Another assumption of the ancient astronomy
was that the heavenly bodies must be perfect sphercs. When Galileo
discovered, by means of the telescope, the existence of cavities in the
moon, it was asserted, in reply, that they were filled with transparent
crystal.

³⁵ Uniformity of opinion, even is it extend to universal consent, is no
evidence of truth.

All men alite might be mad, and there might be no one to observo
or point out the lact of their madness. Similar suppositione as to the
possibility oi the universality of error are constantly started by Descartes,
andare resolved, in his philosophy, hythe consideration of the veracity
of God, who would never have so formed his creatores as to be exposed
to the risi ol insuperable deception.

Though this Aphorism is stated in an extravagant form, it suggests two
very important consideratione: (1) the relativity oi human knowledge,
(a) the possibility ol universal error.

With reference to the first, the student may consult, amongst recent
weitings, Sir W. Hamilton’s Essay on the Philosophy of the Unconditioned '
(published in the ‘Discussions’), his Lectures on Metaphysics, Lects.

remarks, directly suggested by Bacon’s supposition. All truth must
be relative to ourselves, that is to the special constitution of the human
