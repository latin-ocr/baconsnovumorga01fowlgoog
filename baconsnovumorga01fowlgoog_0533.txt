majorem. Etenim visio non bene transigitur ad tactum, sed
indiget medio et distantiam. Licet meminerim me audisse
ex relatione cujusdam fide digni, quod ipse in curandis
oculorum suorum cataractis (erat autem cura talis, ut im-
mitteretur sestuca¹³ quaedam parva argentea intra primam
oculi tunicam, quae pelliculam illam cataractae removeret
et truderet in angulum oculi) clarissime vidisset festucam κ
illam supra ipsam pupillam moventem. Quod utcunque
verum esse possit, manifestum est majora corpora non bene
aut distincte cerni nisi in cuspide coni, coeuntibus radiis
objecti ad nonnullam distantiam ¹⁴. Quin etiam in senibus 3
oculus melius cernit remoto objecto paulo longius, quam 3
propius 1⁵. In missilibus autem certum est percussionem non i
fieri tam fortem ad distantiam nimis parvam, quam paulo
post ¹⁰. Haec itaque et similia in mensuris motuum quoad
distantias notanda sunt.

Est et aliud genus mensurae localis motuum, quod non
praetermittendum est. Illud vero pertinet ad motus non

¹² Cp. Sylva sylvarum, Exp. 272, where the same story about the

operation ior cataract is told. There is, I am informed, no intrinsic ,

· improbability in it.

On the power of accommodatiora by which the eye adapts itself to ,
variations in the distances of objects‚ the student, who is not already ¹

acquainted with the structure ol the eye and the phenomena os the sense

of vision, may consult Ganot's Physics, 7th Ed„ §§ 582-3, or Carpenter's 3
Physiology, 4th Ed, ξ 877. lt generally requires a great effort to see i

very near objects‚ aud at a certain distance from the eye, varying with
different persons and with the size and colour of the objects‚ the image on
the retina becomes blurred.

¹⁴ Sc. from the object itsell, not from the retina of the eye, which would
be absurd.

¹⁵ This is true, as a general rule. ‘We commonly meet with myopia
(short-sightedness) in young persons, and with presbyopia (long-sighted·
uess) in old: but this is by no means the invariable rule; lor even aged
persons are sometimes “short-sighted,” and “long-sightedness” is occa·

sionally met with amongst the young.’ Dr. Carpenter, Physiology, § 879. ¹

¹⁶ While the ball is travelling upwards, the velocity diminishes instead of

increasing, and so, contrary to what Bacon supposed, the initial velocity is ,
greater than the velocity at any other point on the upward path. A ¹

projectile traces a parabola, and it may easily be shown that the velocity at

ppy <pointt oi the parabola is that which would be acquired in falling from
e trec nx.
