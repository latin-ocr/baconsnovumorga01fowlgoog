⁹⁵ Here Bacon advocates the employment of hypothesis, notwithstanding
his implied condemnation of it in the first Book. See i. 19, and my note
upon it. His remark at the beginning of the present Aphorism is con·
ceived in a far truer and more scientific spirit than the language which
(unless we except that of i. 106, q. v.) he has hitherto employed on the
subject. To repeat what l have said elsewhere: ‘Even though a hypo-
thesis may ultimately be discovered to be false, it may be of great service
in pointing the way to a truer theory. Thus the circular theory of
planetary motion, and the supplementary theory of epicycles aud eccen-
trics, undoubtedly contributed to the formation of the hypothesis which
was eventually proved to be true. Kepler himself tried no less than
nineteen different hypotheses, before he hit upon the right one, and his
ultimate success was doubtless in no slight degree due to his unsuccessful
efforts. There is hardly any branch of science in which it might not be
affirmed that, without a number of false guesses, true theories could never
have been attained.’ Inductive Logic, 3rd Ed, p. 98.

Mr. Ellis (in his General Preface, rol. i. pp. 36, 37) makes the following
important remarks on the relation of this llphorism to the others of the
Second Book: ‘The phrase Permissio Intellectus sufficiently indicates
that in this process the mind is suffered to follow the course most
natural to it; it is relieved from the restraints hitherto imposed on it, aad
reverts to its usual state. ln this vindemiatio we accordingly lind no
reference to the method of exclusion: it rests immediately on the three
tables of Compareutia; and though of course it does not contradict the
results of the Exclusiva, yet on the other hand it is not derived from them.
lf we lose sight of the real nature of this part of the investigation‚ which is
merely introduced by the way “because truth is more easily extricated
from error than from confusion,” we also lose sight of the scope and
purport of the whole method. All that Bacon proposes henceforth to do
is to perfect the Exclusiva3 the vindemiatio prima, though it is the closing
member of the example which Bacon makes use of, is not to be taken as
the type of the final conclusion ol any investigation which he would
