124 INTRODUC T ΙΟΝ.

expressed or already admitted 01 being expressed, in a matbematical
lorm. Hence, we cannot be surprised 11 the names 01 CopernicuS,
Galileo‚ and Kepler had for Newton a greater attraction than that
01 Bacon, though it by no means follows that he regarded him
otherwise than with respect and admiration, or that he would not
have been ready fully to express his obligations to him sor having
insisted ou raising the superstructum 01 experimental, aud therefore
ultimately of all science, on the true foundations 01 observatius,
experiment, and induction.

Having now, as 1 conceive, succeeded in establishing the fact 01
Βο000’0 influence on the progressos science, l have next to asli what
the nature 01 that influencewas. The title 01 founder or father 01
experimental philosophy, ascribed 10 11110 by illaclaurin and others,
expresses the nature of his influence in a rough, and, perhaps, a
somewhat exaggerated as well as a somewhat inadequate form, but
one which, l think, is, in the main, true. Instead, however, 01
criticising this or similar expressions, it is better that l should state
precisely the conclusions on this subjectat which 1 have mysell
arrived.

rst, He called men, as with the voice 01 a herald³⁸, to lay them·
selves alongside 01 nature, to study her ways, and imitate her processes.
To use his own homely simile, he raug the hell which called the other
wits together ⁸⁰. Other men indeed had said much the same thing in
whispers or in learned booles written for a circle 01 select readers3
but Bacon cried it from the house-tops‚ and invited all men to come
in freely and partake 01 1110 feast. In one word, he popularised the
study 01 nature.

and, He insisted, both by example and precept, on the importance
01 experiment as well as observation. Nature, like a witness, when
put to the torture, would reveal her secrets. Experimentation was
undoubtedly common in Bacon’s time, but 11 was generally associated
with the Alchemists, and sc, while it suffered in reputation, it was
confined in range. Bacon gave 11 an extension, a dignity, a popu·
larity which, it is not too much to say, must bave materially influenced
the labours 01 the Royal Society, and the crowning efforts of Boyle
and Newton.

³¹ Thus, he says 01 himself (De Augm. iv. 1 ad init.): 'Ego enim buccinator
ῒεῗηῗὴῗνῗ only taken upon me 10 ring a bell to 0011 other wits together! 101101
