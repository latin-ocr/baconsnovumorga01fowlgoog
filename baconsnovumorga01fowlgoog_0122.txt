INTRODUCTION. 99

Before leaving this branch of our subject, it is only fair to mention
one very peculiar circumstance connected with it. Hobbes had, in
early life, been Bacon’s secretary, but, though he wrote a work ex-
pressly on ‘Computation or Logic‚' there is no mention in it of
Inductionl, of the Baconian method, or of Bacon himself. Itis,
perhaps, still more singular that there is no mention of Bacon in
the Epistle Dedicatory to the Elements of Philosophy (Molesworth’s
Edition, English Works, vol. i. ad init), where he refers to Galileo,
Kepler, Harvey‚ Gassendi, Mersenne, uc. Bacon's name, in fact, so
far as Ι anr aware, occurs only twice in the whole of Hobbes' works,
and there without any epithet of praise or blame (see Problemata
Physica, Molesworth's Edition, Latin Works, vol. iv. p. 3173 De-
cameron Physiologicum, English Works, vol. vii. p. 112). From the
extent of Hobbes' writings and the intimate personal relations which
had formerly existed between him and Bacon, I can hardly refer
this silence to mere accident. It may have been due to some per-
sonal pique‚ or the abstract character of Hobbes' mind may have
rebelled against the concrete and inductive spirit of Bacon’s philo·
sophy. For, it may be noticed that there are few writers on moral
and political questions, in whose works the historical spirit is more
conspicuously absent than in Hobbes.

Remusat draws attention to the silence of Lord Herbert of Cher·
bury, but the whole bent of his genius was so different from that of
Bacon, that this is hardly surprising.

spinosa, in a letter written in 1661 (Bruder’s Ed, vol. ii. p. 146,
Ep. ii), has some interesting remarlrs on Bacon, Having been asked
his opinionon Bacon and Descartes, he objects to them, firstly‚ ‘quod
tam longe recognitione primae causae et origine omnium rerum aber·
rarint ;’ secondy, ‘quod veram naturam humanae mentis non cogno-
verint;’ thirdly, ‘quod veram causam erroris nunquam assecuti sint!
He then proceeds to criticise Bacon’s Idola Tribus. In Ep. 42 (p.
270), there is another allusion to Bacon: ‘Ad haec intelligendum,
saltem quoad methodus exigit, non est opus, naturam mentis per
primam ejus causam cognoscere, sed sufficit, mentis sive percep-
tionum historiolam concinnare modo illo, quo Verulamius docet!

¹ Rfmusat, whose remarks on Hobbes (pp. 405-408) seem to me very just aud
interesting, says that, to thebert of his belief, the word Induction occurs only once
irr Hobbes' writings. This is in amuthernatieal controversy with Wallis <Moles-
worth's Fid, Latin Worlrs, vol. iv. p. 179), where he says in a spirit the very reverse
ol Baconian: ¹Inductio autem demonstratio uon est, nisi ubi particularia omnic
mumemntar, quod hic est impossibile!
