foundation ⁸¹. At the same time, considering the obscurity of the
views of motion which then prevailed‚ and the fact that the weight of

the atmosphere had not yet been discovered, we are not here so much
justified in complaining oi ignoranoe, asos a want oi that insight
which in a man of Bacon’s genius might possibly have been expected.
Connected with these opinions, arethe theory that air has no weight,
being indifferent as regards gravity and levity, and that fleme and
‘living spirits' are positively light ⁰².

Passing to a very different subiect, we lind that, os the tried oi
Paracelsus‚ sulphur, mercury, and salt, Bacon adopts two principles,
namely sulphur and mercury, as pervading the universe (quasi per
universitatem rerum permeare), and being the very foundation oi
matter (natiuae admodum primordiales, et penitissimos materiae
schematismos; et inter Formas Primae Classis iere praecipuas) ⁸³.
The mode in which he traces these principles through all things in
heaven and earth and under the earth appears to us peculiarly absurd.
He omits Salt, as compounded os the two others, but, in doing so, can
hardly be said to have improved on the theory ol Valentinus and
Paraeelsus. In two notes on Nov. Org. ii. 50 (6) ad init, 1 have

spolren at such length on the history os this dogma, and the manner
in which Bacon presents it in various parts oi his works, that it

would be superfluous to say anything further on the subjectio this
lace. '

p That in the Sylva Sylvarum (on which, however, see the apologetio

remarks ol Rawley in his presace to the worlr⁸⁴) Bacon affords his coun-

tenance to many of the most absurd sancies oi his time, is a fact so well

known and so universally consessed, that it hardly requires illustration.

⁸¹ He certainlycriticises the explanatione given (Nov. Org. ii. 35), but he does not
call in question the supposed laets themselves. It should, perhaps, also be men·
tioned that he does not recognise in air and similar bodies 'tarn sortis appetitus
petendi superiora, quam putatur.' Historia Densi et Rari (E. and S, vol. ii.
v· 255)-

⁰ Artirnal spirits, as being compounded ot' air and ilame, are interrnediate, in
point os levity, between the two. See Historia Densi et Rari (E. and S, vol. ii.
pp. 255, 256). ‘At spiritus vivos aere ipso aliquanto rariores existimamus: turn
quia inflammantur nonnihil; tum quia diligenter experti sumus, aerem ad minu-
endum aut sublevandum pondus nihil conferre ...... At corpus animale rivum
et mortuum gravitate manifesto differunt, licet haud tantum quantum putantur.
Quare videtur aer pondus non minuere: spiritus autem vivus hoc seuere!

Salis (Ε, and S, rol. ii. p. 82).
