LIB. J. 106-108. · 305

fortasse complexu umbras et formas abstractas, non solida et
determinata in materia, prensemus. Haec vero curn in usum
venerint, solida tum demum spes merito affulserit.

Atque hic etiam resumendum est, quod superius dictum
est⁹ de Naturali Philosophia producta et scientiis particulari·
bus ad eam reductis, ut non fiat scissio et tnrncatio scienti-
arum3 nam etiam absque hoc miuus de progressu sperandum

est.
CVIII.

Atque de desperatione tollenda et spe facienda, ex praete-
riti temporis erroribus valere jussis aut rectificatiS, jam dictum
est. Videndum autem et si quae alia sint quae spem faciant.
Illud vero occurrit; si hominibus non quaerentibus, et aliud
agentibus multa utilia, tanquam casu quodam aut per oc-
casionem, inventa sint3 nemini dubium esse posse, quin
iisdem quaerentibus et hoc agentibus, idque via et ordine,

it does not positIvely prove it. See my Inductive Loglc, 3rd ed,
pp. 113·1¹9·

Mr. Spedding very appositely quotes the following passage from Valerius
Terminus (E. and S., vol. iii. p. ml: ‘That the discovery of new works ¹
and active directions not known before, Is the only trial to be accepted οῖς
and yet not that neither, In case where one partlcular glveth light to
another3 but where particulam induce an axiom or observation, which
axiom found out discovereth and designeth new particulare. That the
nature of this trial ls not only upon the poiut, whether the knowledge
be profitable or no, but even upon the poInt whether the knowledge be
true or no; not because you may always conclude that the Axiom which
discovereth new instances Is true, but contrariuise you may safely conclude
that if it discover not any new instance it is in vain and untrue.'

⁹ See Aphs. 79, 80, with the notes upon thern. Here, as in those
AphorIsms, there seems to be some confusion between Natural Philosophy
and the Philosophia Prima. The metaphors ‘scissio et truncatio' cer·
tainly apply to the Philosophia Prima, as described in De humentis,
lib. iii. cap. r, rather than to Natural Philosophy, as described in the sub·
sequent chapters of the same Book.

Of the justice, however, of Bacon’s remark, and of its supreme Import-
ance, there can be no doubt. The results of the labours of speciallsts
require to be gathered together into one science, and the various sciences
themselves to be compared and brought into harrnony, if human knowledge
is to progress as a whole and we are to command a real insight into the
ways of nature.
