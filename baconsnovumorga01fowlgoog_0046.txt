This section (which must necessarily be far brieter than its' itn·
portance demands, thoughI trust that its omissions will, to a great
extent, be supplied in the notes on the Novum Organum itself) cannot
be more appropriately commenced than hythe following sketch of
Bacon's errors and omissions, traced, it must be remembered, by
the not unfriendly hand of tur. Spedding ⁴¹:

‘It is impossible, 1 think, to read Mr. Ellis's remarks upon those
“ parts of his works in which he comes in contact with what we call the
exact sciencia—mathematica,for instance, and mechanica—and not
to feel thatin the facultyof tdrtahguettag affirmata—the faculty
whose office is (as he describes it in.the Novum Organum, i. 55) figere
contemplationes, et morari et haerere in omni subtilitate (inferentiarum,-
he was (comparatively at least) deficient. This appears both from
the imperfect account of the existing condition of those sciences
which he gives in the De Augmentis Scientiarum ; no notice being
there taken of sonte of the most important advances which had been
made by the *writers immediately preceding him; and from his own
experiments and speculations upon subjects which required their help.
Though he pald great attention to Astronomy, discussed carefully
the methods in which it ought to be studied‚ constructed for the
satisfaction of hisown mind an elaborate theory of the heavens, and
listened eagerly for the news from the stars brought by Galileo’s
telescope, he appears to have been utterly ignorant of the discoveries
which had just been made by Keplets calculations⁴². Though he
complained in 1623 of the want of compendious methods for faclli·
tating arithmetical computations, especially with regard to the doctrine
of Series, and fully recognised the importance of them as an aid
to physical enquiriest he does not say a word about Napiets
Logarithms, which had been published only nine years before and

‘¹ Prefaoe to the 'De interpretatione Naturae Prooemium, vol. iii. pp. 510-512.
The whole of this Prefaoe is very interesting. Mr. Spedding ascribes Bacon's
arenul defecta aad his ignorance of so many scientifrc details mainly to the great
predominanoe, in his mind, of the discursive over the critical faculty, the faculty
which detects the broader resemblances ¹and more striking analogica of things ove
that which notes differeuoes and patieutly studies particular facts.

⁴¹ See Mt. Ellis's Prefacc to the Descriptio Globi Intellectnalis. [Vol. iii. pp. ⁷² 3,
7²4. ‘The treatise De Stella Martis was published in 1609. and becarroe known in
anland at least as eartyas 1610. Harriot, it appears from Professor Rigaud's
account of his papers, was theu in correspondence with Kepler, and repeated his
calculations. That Bacou was acquainted with his writings we can hardly believe;
they bear so directly on the questions which he has discussed that he could scarcely
have neglected to notice them, had he known them even by report.']
