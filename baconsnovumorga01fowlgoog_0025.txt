this course, l have assumed in my readers a certain amount of
acquaintance with the history of philosophical speculation, as well as
with the outlines of logie. But to readers, who do not corne to the
study of the bpolr with this amount of acquirement‚ l cannot think
that an edition, worth the putting out, could be of any service.

The arrangement of the Sections has been a matter of some
difficulty, as several of thern stand in little relation to those that pre·
cede or follow. On the whole‚l have thought it most convenient,
keeping apart as far as possible the expository sections from those
which are mainly htstoricat and bringing together those which stand
in any close connection, to adopt the following order:
