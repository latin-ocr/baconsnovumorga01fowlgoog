412 NOVUM ORGANUM.

Verum hac in re proponendum est etiam exemplum periculi
et cautionis, de quibus diximus. Nimirum facile hic occurret
intellectui ab hujusmodi efficientibus depravato, quod ad for-
mam albedinis ae'r semper requiratur, aut quod albedo gene-
retur tantum per corpora diaphana; quae omnino salsa sunt,
et per multas exclusiones convicta ⁴¹⁴. Quin potius apparebit
(misso ae're et hujusmodi) corpora omnino aequalia (secundum
portiones opticas) dare diaphanum; corpora vero inaequalia
per texturam simplicem, dare album3 corpora inaequalia
secundum texturam compositam, sed ordinatam, dare reliquos
colores praeter nigrum3 corpora vero inaequalia per texturam
compositam, sed omnino inordinatam et confusam, dare
nigrum ⁴⁵. Itaque de instantia migrante ad generationem

worth adding that Bacon notices the phenomena of Resraction, properly
so called, in Sylva sylvarum, Exps. 761, 762.

‘⁴ ln this passage, Bacon seems explicitly to recognise what we call the
Plurality of Causes, namely, the lact that an event may be due to various
causes or distinct sets of conditions. An argument might hence be deduced
in favour of the position that by Form he invariably intends to express nature
or essence rather than cause. As l have stated, however, in the Introduc-
tion, 1 believe that the word is employed by him in various shades of
meaning in different places. Should it be said that the form is the set
of conditions immediately preceding the phenomenon, as it appears to us,
and that this is bivariably the same, it must be borne in mind that, even ir
we granted this to be the case, the difficulty connected with Plurality
of Causes would recur with regard to the set of conditions immediately
preceding this, or the set immediately preceding that, and so on ; so that it
would only be postponed, not eliminated.

⁴⁵ This explanation of the colour of bodies is mere grass-work. We
have no sufficient evidence, at least as yet, for determining the conditions
on which the absorption of colours by various bodies dopends. ln New·
ton’s Optics, bk. ii. pt. iii, there is a curious and interesting attempt to
determine the same problem. Thus, for instance, Newtou thinks that ‘The
Bigness of the Component Parts of Natural Bodies may be conjectured by
their colours3' that ‘for the production of Black, the corpuscles must
be less than any of those which exhibit colours3' and that ‘microscopes
may at length be improved to the discovery os the particles of bodies
on which their colours depend, ii they are not already in some measure
arrived to that degree of perlection'

There is a long passage on the theory of Colours in Valerius Terminus
(E. and S, rol. iii. p. 236, Sto). Notwithstanding much that is crude in
Bacon’s speculations, we have only to compare them with such a book
as Telesius de Coloribus, to see. on how much firmer ground the physicists
oi his age were treading than those of the previous generation.
