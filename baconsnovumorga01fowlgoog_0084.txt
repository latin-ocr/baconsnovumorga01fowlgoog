INTRODUCTION. 61

cepimus: sed et rem in ulterius provehimus, et lortiora auxilia in
usum intellectus machinamur et ministramus; quae nunc subjun-
gemus ⁴²!

Now, perhaps, the first remark that occurs to one inconsidering this
method is that it seems to be assumed that every ‘simple nature' has
some other ‘simple nature' which is its form, or part of its lorrn. Thus,
heat, which is itsell a simple nature, is a species ol motion, or, to
put the same thing in different words, an effect ol motion. Some
ol the ‘simple natures‚' then, are genera or causes of the other
simple natures. But, il so, there must evidently be some one or
more of the ‘simple natures' which cannot be brought under any
genus or cause. This or these, then, have no ‘form ¹¹!

Another remark, already made by Mr. Ellisss, is that ol the two
concomitant natures, or, as we have put it, ol the two natures
invariably connected, there is nothing to determine which is the Form
of the other, except the somewhat vague statement that one, besides
being convertible with the other, is a limitation ol some ‘more general
naturez’ ‘inveniatur natura alia, quae sit curn natura data convertibilia,
et tamen sit limitatio naturae notioris, instar generis veri ⁴⁴! It might,
however, be asked‚ how are we to ascertain the genus ol which tha
Form is the limitation and the ‘natura data’ the species? How, lor
instance, are we to know that beat is a species of motion, rather than
motion a species of heat? And still, before wc begin to search
for the differentia, this preliminary point must be settled. The best
solution, it appears to me, of this difficulty is to suppose that Bacon
was thinking quite as much ol the relation ol cause and effect as
of that os genus and species, and that the subsequence in thought of
the ‘limitation’ (constituting the species) to the genus which it qualilies
should be translated, in order to express his meaning lully, into the
subsequence in time of the effect to the cause The question which
os two natures is cause, and which effect, can, ol course, always be
determined in any individual instance, if we can ascertain which os
the two has preceded the other.

⁸ This, perhaps, may have been the reason why Bacon, in writing the second
book of the Novum Organum, changed his example lrom Motion to Heat. It
would have been found very difficolt to assign the‘ form' ol Motion. For this
earlier example ol his method‚ ‘Filum Labyrinthi, sive Inquisitio legitima de
Motu: see Ellis and Spedding, vol.' ni. pp. 621- 640.
