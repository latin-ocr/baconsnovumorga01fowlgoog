⁴¹ dentalyyin. The allusion is to the New Academy, the principal
representatives of which were Arcesilaus and Carneades, and which mainly
floun'shed in the third and second centuries u. c. For a detailed account of
the doctrines of this school, the reader may refer to any of the more
recent Histories of Greek Philosophy, such as Ueberweg's or Zeller's.
The following brief notice will enable him to understand Bacon’s allusions
to the school here and elsewhere.

The New Academy, which, as its name imports, professed to be an
offshoot of Platonism, may be regarded partly as a development of the
sceptical and negative vein which had, from the first, formed part of
the Platonic impulse, partly as a strong reaction against the dogmatism
of the Stoics. The Stoics had maintained that, besides ἐπιστήμη, de·
monstrable knowledge, and δόξα, mere opinion, there is 'a third and
intermediate kind of knowledge, quite trustworthy, but not demonstrabis.
This was called φαντασία καταληπτικὴ or κατάληψις. According to the
Stoics, says Tennemann‚ ‘every original representation is the result of
impressions produced upon the mind, and hence of sensational perceptions;
and is therefore denominated φαντασία, visana Out of these original and
sensational impressions, Reason, a superior and directing power (τὸ ἡγε-
μονικόν), forms our other representations. The true are styled by Zeno
φαντάσιαι καταληπτικαί, οῐ· καταλήψεις, that is, such as are verified by their
correspondence with the object to which they refer, are freely assented
to, and constitute the foundation of science! The greater part of our
physical and ethical knowledge the Stoics held to be of this intermediate
description. ln opposition to this theory, the philosophers of the New
Academy maintained the doctrine of ἀκαταληψία, that is the impossibility
of attaining to such καταλήψεις. According to the ordinary account, which
is that adopted by Bacon, they recognised only one certain proposition,
namely, that nothing can be known with certainty. lt was this dogmatic
scepticism (ι Nova Academia acatalepsiam dogmatizavit et ex professo
tenuit’ Aph. 67) which, as is generally supposed, distinguished this school
from the Pyrrhonists, Ephectici, or Sceptics proper. The latter en·
deavoured to maintain an ἐποχή (suspension of judgment) between the
affirmation and negation of propositions, saying that it is impossible to
know whether we know anything or not. The ἀταραξία (or imperturb-
ableness of mind) which the realisation of this uncertainty produces is
the supreme end of philosophy.

Ueberweg, however, questions the accuracy of the popular distinction
between the New Academy and the Sceptics. He regards, indeed, the
