arbitrio su0, naturae rerum imposuerit: magis ubique sol-
licitus²³ quomodo quis respondendo se explicet, et aliquid
reddatur in verbis positivum, quam de interna rerum veritate;
quod etiam optime se ostendit in comparatione philosophiae
ejus ad alias philosophias quae apud Graecos celebrabantur.

ship, and the motion of the sea. This distinction is often applied by
Aristotle to the motions of the heavenly bodies. See, ior instance, De
Coelo, ii. 13 (p. ²93 a. 1,&c.)‚ Phys. viii. 6 (²59 b. 28, tito). Cp. De
Coelo, ii. 1⁴ (296 b. 27, dcc). The Aristotelian terms by which Proper
Motion is expressed are οἶκείιι or ἴδιοι φορά.

²³ This tendency is abundantly exemplilied in Aristotle’s physical worlrs.
He is so anxious to solve every difficulty which presents itseli to
his mind, that he is seldom content with a bare statement oi iacis, without
starting some theory in explanation oi them. As a consequence of this
tendency, the facts are often very meagre‚ and the theories very crude.

²⁴ τὸ ὁμοιομερῆ may denote either aggregatos composed of lilre parts, or
these ‘like parts' themselves. Anaxagoras maintained that there was an
infinity of elements, some of which were homogenous with others, though
in the original chaos they were all mixed up io inextricable confusion.
Thus, there existed from the first particles of flesh, bone, &c., which, by
a process of oiryxpwu and διάκρισις, have been disentangled from the dis·
orderly mass and iashioned by vois or the Supreme intelligence into flach,
bone, δια, as we now find them iu the κόσμοι or orderly universe. Πάντα
χρήματα ἦν ὁμοῦ· εἶτα νοῦς ἐλθὼν αὐτὰ διεκόσμησε. See Metaph. i. 3.

For the various philosophical theories mentioued in this paragraph, the
student should refer to the passages collected in Ritter and Preller’s His-
toria Philosophiae, as wellas to some good History oi Philosophy, such as
that oi Ueberweg, Zeller, or Lewes.

²⁵ These atoms, unlile the homoiomera of Anaxagoras, had no qua·
litative differente. They were supposed to differ only in shape (σχήματι)
as A and N, or arrangement (τάξει) as AN and NA, or position (θέσει) as
Z and N. The κόσμοι resulted irom these atoms through ἀνάγκη. See
Metaph. i. 4.

²⁶ Coelum et terra=nip καὶ γῆ. lt is questionable how far Parmenides
intended to express physical conceptions by these words, and how far he
intended them to be simply symbolic of the metaphysical contrast of being

and non-being. Τούτων δι’, says Aristotle, τὸ μὲν κατὰτὸ ὃν, τὸ θερμὸν τάττει, .

θάτερον δὲ κατὰ τὸ μὴ ὅν. See Metaph. i. 5. The student might ltere, with
advantage, consult Schwegler’s History of Philosophy, in addition to
Ueberweg and Ritter and Preller.

²⁷ The well-known four elements of Empedocles, which were generally
accepted till a comparatively recent date, were supposed by him to have
