prodendas salsas formas, et dissipandas leves contemplationes

intellectui addant ²³.

Exempli gratia: sint¹ naturae inquisitae quatuor naturae
illae, quas contubernales vult esse Telesius²⁴, et tanquam ex
eadem camera; viz. calidum, lucidum, tenue, mobile sive
promptum ad motum. At plurimae inveniuntur instantiae
diuortii inter ipsas. Aer enim tenuis est et habilis ad motum,
non calidus aut lucidus3 luna lucida, absque calore; aqua
fervens calida, absque lumine; motus acus ferreae super ver-
sotium pernix et agilis, et tamen in corpore frigido, denso,
opaco; et complura id genus.

Similiter sint naturae inquisitae Natura Corporea et Actio
Naturalis. Videtur enim non inveniri actio naturalis, nisi
subsistens in aliquo corpore. Attamen possit fortasse esse
circa hanc rem instantia nonnulla divortii. Ea est actio
magnetica, per quarn ferrum fertur ad magnetem, gravia ad
globum terrae ²⁶. Addi etiam possint aliae nonnullae opera·
tiones ad distans. Actio siquidem hujusmodi etin tempore

¹⁴ See Telesius, De Rerum Nauna, passim3 especially lib. i. capp. 1, r.
Thus, of the Sun, he says: ‘omnino calidus, tenuis, candidus, mobilisque
est Sol: Terra contra, frigida, crassa, immobilis, tenebricosaque.’

¹⁶ Cp. last Aphorism, Enample (3), where, on the other hand, he seems
to distinguish between magnetic attraction and the attraction exercised by
the earth.

Bacon's idea appears to have been that magnetism and terrestrial attrac-

tion (which he here speaks of as if they were the same) act without ,

affecting the interrnediate bodies (air, ether, or whatever they may be);
that they act in time; and, hence, that ‘the natural action' or ‘ virtue ' is,
as it were, tor a while suspended between the acting body and the body
acted upon. From this he infers that ‘natural action' may be detached
from any ‘ corporeal nature.’

The manner iu which gravitation acts is still unknown. We know the
fact and the law, but all the rest is mere matter of speculation. Whether
the force does or does not require a material medium for its propagation,
and whether it is or is not transmitted in time, are questions which have
not yet been resolved and which, perhaps, admit of no solution. lt was
calculated by Laplace that, if its velocity be measurable at all, it must be,
at least, fifty milliens ot⁴ times greater than the velocity of light. As to the
medium, though there are grounds tor believing in the existence ota subtle
