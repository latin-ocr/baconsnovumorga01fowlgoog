Here we seem to 11ον0 the first note 01 the key which was
afterwards struck with such 011001 by Chillingworth in his Religion
01 Protestants,-by Jeremy Taylor in his Liberty 01 Prophesying, and,
above all, by 100110 111 his Letters on Toleration. And, like these
writers, Bacon probably did 1101 see the consequences 01 his own
principles. Like them, he would probably have set limits to Tolera·
tion, nor am I sure that he would not have set precisely the same
limits as Locke‚ namely, by excluding ‘Papists’ on the one side
01111 ‘Atheists' on the other. As 111 the case 01 100110, 100, 01111,
perhaps, 01 all who advocated Toleration in those days, when the
true principles 01 Ρο1111001 Philosophy were so imperfectly understood,
Bacon’s real against persecution and intolerance arose, probably, in no
small measure, from vngueness‚ uncertainty‚ or indifference, in his own

oth. The indifference 01 which 1 have just spoken was, Ι think,
certainly one 01 Bacon's characteristics in relation to religione 0011-
troversies. It was 1101 merely that 110 saw the hollowness or absurdity
01 many 01 the disputes current in his own day. ‘A man that is 01

judgment and understanding shall sometimes 11001 ignorant men differ,
and know well within himself that those which so differ mean one
thing, and yet they themselves would never agree.¹ ‘Men create
oppositions which are not; and put them into new terma so fixed, as
whereas the meaning ought to govern the term, the term 11011001
governeth the meaning²².' A man so acute as Bacon could 1101
help seeing thus 101, but his 10111110101100, I think, entended 101 beyond
the range 01 these mere verbal quibbles and scholastic combats.
His indifference was 1101 simply an indifference 01 the head3 it was
011 indifference 01 the beart. What he really cared 101 was the
advancement 01 10101100, the knowledge 01 nataae, the extension 01
the kingdom 01 11101111. Ηο did 1101 repudiate religion, or even
theology; rather, he was a respectsul, though silent, worshipper;
but, like m'any another man, he entered the shrine only 011 occasion,
while, at most times, his business lay 101 away. There was, perhaps,
01010111 feeling that not much knowledge was to be had in these
subjecta, numerous 01111 eager as were the workmen engaged in
