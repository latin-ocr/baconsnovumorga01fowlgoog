mente Francisci Baconis Verulamii, et ejus sequentium vestigia!
Here and elsewhere he is profuse in his praise of Bacon.

Boerhaave, who, as Mr. Napier says, was himself an eminent
improver of science in several of its branches, and who was placed
in a situation, which, in a particular manner, enabled him to collect
the general sentiment of Europe upon any point connected with the
history of philosophy, in his Discourse de comparando certo in
Physicis, delivered before the University of Leyden in 1715, pro·
nounced an eulogium on Bacon which it would be difficult to exceed:
‘Atque hujus quidem Physices fortunas laudare licet ex quo magnum
Verulamium summo suo bono accepit! Vimm certe ad omnia, quae
seientia humana comprehendi possunt, indaganda facile principem,
etde quo dubites utrum consilio, an exemplo, major fuerit in in·
stauranda deformata Physica Absque invidia dixero, quidquid
incrementi cepit naturalis historia ab ineunte decimo sexto seculo
in hane usque horam, omne id acceptum debemus monitis et pre·
ceptis illius viri; cujus indelibilem memoriam grata colet orbis
perpetuitas!
⁴ Similar is the testimony of Buddaeus (Compendium Historiae
Philosophicae, Ed. of 17 31, pp. 409-412): ‘Saeculo decimo septimo
ineunte, nova lux philosophiae, praesertim in scientia naturali, orta
est. Exemplum omnibus praeivit Franclscus Baco de Verulamio,
qui, ut, missis abstractis illis et otiosis speculationibus, ad particularia
descenderent experimentaque instituendo naturam rerum accuratius
contemplarentur, omnibus auctor fuit. Hujus ductum cum multi

sequerentur, dici non potest, quanta ad accuratiorem philosophiam
facta sit accessio!

Morhof (Polyhistor, tomi. lib. a. cap. 7) speaks of a work,
published in Huugary in 1663, by one John Beyer, entitled ‘Filum
Labyrinthi vel Cynosura, sive Lux mentium universalis,' ec, in which
the author attempted to expound the Baconian philosophy. ‘Verum
obscurat potius Verulamii sensus omnemque philosophiam, quam ut
lumen aliquod accendat! This fact is interesting as showing that

thelame of Bacon’s philosophical reform had reached even remote
countries like Hungary.

On the possible, or, perhaps, probable influence of Bacon's writings
on the institution of scientific societies abroad, 1 shall have occasion
to speak in a note on the next division of my subject.

Retuming to England,l shall now attempt to shew the influence
