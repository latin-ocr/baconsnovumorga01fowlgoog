experimentum illud satis vulgatum, cum recipitur ramus aliquis
vitis intra domum ubi sit iocus assiduus ex quo maturescunt
uvae etiam mense integro citius quam foras3 ita ut maturatio
fructus etiam pendentis super arborem fieri possit, scilicet ab
igne, cum hoc ipsum videatur esse opus proprium solis⁴⁶.
Itaque ab hoc initio facile insurgit intellectus, repudiata
heterogenia essentiali, ad inquirendum quae sint differentiae
illae quae revera reperiuntur inter calorem solis et ignis, ex
quibus fit ut eorum operationes sint tam dissimiles, utcunque
illi ipsi participent ex natura communi.

Quae differentiae reperientur quatuor: viz. primo, quod calor
solis respectu caloris ignis sit gradu longe clementior et lenior;
secundo, quod sit (praesertim ut defertur ad nos per aerem)
qualitate multo humidior3 tertio (quod caput rei est), quod sit
summe inaequalia, atque accedens et auctuS, et deinceps rece-
denset diminutus; id quod maxime confert ad generationem

⁴⁰ ‘The regular use of artificia! heat in green-houses and conservatoria
was not known in Bacon's time. ln the Maisan Champe‘tre, an encyclo-
paedia of gardening and agriculture published in 1607, nothing is said
of it; nor is there anything on the subject in the writings of Porta,
though in his Nar. Mag. he has spoken of various modes of accelerating
the growth of truits and flowers. ln the Sylva Sylvarum (412), however,
Bacon speaks ot housing hot-country planta to save thern, and, in the
Essay on Gardens, of stoving myrtles. The idea of what are now called
green-houses was introduced into England from Holland about the time
of the Revolution. The orangery at Heidelberg, formed, Ι believe, about
the middle of the seventeenth century, is said to be the earliest conservatory
on record.

‘lt is related that Albertus Magnus, entertaining the emperor at Cologne
during the winter, selected for the place of entertainment the garden of
his monastery. Everything was covered with snow, and the guests were
much inclined to be discontented; but when the feast began, the snov
cleared away; the trees put forth, first leaves, then blossoms, then truit;
and the climate became that oi summer. This glorious summer, which
had thus abruptly succeeded to the winter of their discontent, lasted
only to the conclusion of the feast, when everything resumed its former
aspect. lt would be a sanciful explanation, and l know not whether it
has ever been suggested, to say that hibertus Magnus really entertained
the emperor in a conservatory, and only led his guests through the garder.
