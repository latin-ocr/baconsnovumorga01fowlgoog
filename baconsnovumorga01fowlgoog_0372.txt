LIB. II. 7. 349

bus⁴¹: praesertim in rebus specificatis⁴² et earum partibus, ut
ferri, lapidis; et partibus similaribus plantae, animalis, veluti
radicis, folii, floris, carnis, sanguinis, ossis, etc. At etiam in
hoc genere non prorsus cessavit industria humana; hoc ipsum
enim innuit separatio corporum similarium per distillationes
et alios solutionum modos, ut dissimilaritas compositi per con·
gregationem partium homogenearum appareat. Quod etiam
ex usu est, etfacit ad id quod quaerimus; licet saepius res
fallax sit; quia complures naturae separationi imputantur et
attribuuntur, acsi prius substitissent in composito, quas revera
ignis et calor et alii modi apertionum de novo indunt et super·
inducunt. Sed et haec quoque parva pars est operis ad inve·
niendum sclzematzkmum verum in composito; qui schematismus
res est longe subtilior et accuratior, et ab operibus ignis potius
confunditur quam eruitur et elucescit.

Itaque iacienda est corporum separatio et soluti03 non per
ignem certe, sed per rationem et inductionem veram, cum
experimentis auxiliaribus3 et per comparationem ad alia cor·
pora, et reductionem ad naturas simplices et earum formas4³‚

⁴¹ That ls, which are homogeneous. lt is comparatively easy to dis·
tinguish heterogeueous parts; but the anatomy which attempts to pene·
trate to the ultimate structure of homogeneous matter proposes to itself
a taslr of transcendent difficulty.

⁴² That is, in things which are distinguished as constituting separate
species The only reason, perhaps, that can be given why this should

be the ¹case, is that such things are usually ol a more uniform structure
than things which are not so distinguished. '

The word ‘ stone' is, oi course, used here' ln the most unscientilic way.
The same may be said of ‘root,’ ‘ leaf,’ uc, below.

¹³ Here, ‘forms’ are spoken ofin connection with ‘latent schematisms,'
though, at the beginning of the Aphorism, form was distinguished from
latent schematism and coupled with latent process. This circumstance
allords a good illustration of the vagueness and ambiguity of the term, and
of the mode in which Bacon seems to oscillate between its two meanings

The various ‘Schematismi Materiae’ are enumerated in the De Aug·
mentis, lib. iii. cap. 4 (E. and 8., vol. i. p. 5⁶0)· ln the passage in the text,
Bacon seems to thinlr that, in order to determine the latent schematism or
ultimate constitution of any body, we must specily its qualities‚ dense,
heavy, hot, dcc, and then proceed to ascertain the ‘forms’ of these qua·
lities. The knowledge oi the ‘forms’ ol these ‘simple natures’ will give
all the information which we require. lt rs needless to point out how vague,
undetermined‚ and purely relat' trve are most of the terms which he ern·
ploys to designate the simple natures, or how differentis the roundabout '
