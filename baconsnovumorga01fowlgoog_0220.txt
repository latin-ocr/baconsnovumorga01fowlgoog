cipiis eorumque immota veritate judicat et invenit axiomata
media; atque haec via in usu est. Altera a sensu et particu-

nected deductively with some still higher generalisations which bave been
established on independent grounds. When this final step has been talen,
the axiomata media deduced from it may be accepted with implicit cou-
tidence.

Generally speaking, the axioma maxime generale, even when conceived
before the axiomata media, will rest on an induction from these, as its final
proof; as these themselves will probably rest on lower axioms, and so on till
we reach the axioms which rest on an induction from individual facts.
But, in the order ol conception, though not in the order of prool, the axioma
maxime generale or one ol the highest of the intermediate axioms usually
comes first, and this circumstance it is which distinguishes the method
we are describing from that commended by Bacon.

The history ol the Theory ol Gravitation supplies au example ola
scientific doctrine, the steps of which were established almost in the exact
order which Bacon recommends. This may be seen by consulting the
lnductive Table ol Astronomy giren iu Dr. Whewell's Novum Organum
Renovatum. Moreover, in all sciences this order is the most convenient
mode of representing the laws, when once established, though, as we have
seen, it is by no means that in which they are always actually established,
as a matter of fact. Bearing in mind this qualification, we may adopt
the words of Dr. Whewell :-

‘We have, indeed, already explained that science consists of Propositions
which include the Facts from which they were collected; and other wider
Propositions, collected in like manner from the former, and including
them. Thus, that the stars, the moon, the sun, rise, culminate, and set,
are laets included in the proposition that the heavens, carrying with them
all the celestial bodies, have a diurnal revolution about the axis ol the
earth. dgain, the observed monthly motions ol the moon, and the annual
motions ol the sun, are included in certain propositions concerning the
movements of those luminaries with respect to the stars. But all these
propositione are really included in the doctrine that the earth, revolving on
its axis, moves round the sun, and the moon round the earth. These
movements, again, considered as facts, are explained and included in the
statement of the forces which the earth exerts upon the moon, and tbe
sun upon the earth. Again, this doctrine ol the forces ol these three
bodies is included in the assertion, that all the bodies of the solar system,
and all parts oi matter, exert forces, eacb upon each. And we might easily
shew that all tbe leading facts in astronomy are comprehended in the same
generalisation. ln lilre manner with regard to any other science, sofar as its
trutbs bare been well established and fully developed, we might shew that
it consists of a gradation of propositione, proceeding from the most special
iacts to the most general theoretical assertione! (Novum Organum Reno·
vatum, ch. vi. § r.)

Even in Astronomy, however, the heliocentric hypothesis had occurred
to the ancients long before the state of their knowledge was sufficient
