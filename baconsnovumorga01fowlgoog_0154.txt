'method which has been usually followed by scientihc investigators‚ or
that which would be most likely to contribule to the progress ol seience,
is, certainly, the most convenient mode ol representing the laws of
nature, when once established. Moreover, the successive steps which
led up to, and ultimately established, the Theory oi Gravitation were
arrived at very nearly in this precise order. To these considerations
I may add that the method proposed by Bacon has met with the
approval ol no less distinguished an authority than Dr. Whewell⁴⁶.

With reference to the ‘Tables' which occupy the beginning os the
Second Book, it must he aclmowledged that, however interesting they
may be in the history ol Logic, and however much they may have
contributed to the formulating ol inductive reasoning‚ they are only
rude exemplars oi the more refined and conclusive ‘Canons ol In·
duction' which we lind in the works of Sir John Herschel, Mr. Mill,
and later logicians. Hence, this is a part of Bacon's Logic which is ,
not of much intrinsic value to a student who is already familiar with
recent treatises. To this consideration it may be added that the
reasoning throughout this part of the Novum Organum is rendered
more or less vague and obscure by the employment of the term
‘Form,’ instead oi the more precise expressions, such as Law, Cause,
Conditions, αα, by which it is now replaced.

Oi far more intrinsic value to the modern student, as it seems to
me, are some of the ‘Praerogativae Instantiarum.' Many os the expres·
sions there employed still form part oi our logical terminology‚ and it
would be very difficolt, in many cases, to describe, more aptly and
precisely than Bacon does, the nature ol the reasoning involved. The
scientific examples are, generally, iar too numerous, andare often
wrongly stated, uivial, or inappropriate, but it appears to me that less
attention than it deserves has been paid to the logical matter contained
in this part ol Bacon's worlt.

The relation ol Observation to Experiment and of both to the
more purely rational process of Induction, is well conceived and
stated by Bacon.

To the doctrine oi Fallaces, or ‘Idola' I have already alluded
under the first, or more general head, though it might also well be
taken into account in drawing up a list of the special logical doctrines
which are ol intrinsic value to the modern student.

1t will be seen that I am inclined to attribute to Bacon’s logical
