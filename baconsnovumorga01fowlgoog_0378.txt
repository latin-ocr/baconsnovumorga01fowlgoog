Instantias⁶¹ convenientes in natura calidi.

1. Radii soliS, praesertim aestate et meridie.
2. Radii solis reflexi et constipati, ut inter montes, aut per
parietes, et maxime omnium in speculis comburentibus.

⁸¹ The signiticance of these Instances, as well as of the Tables which
occur in the following Aphorisms, may, perhaps, best be understood by
comparing thern with the far more natural and scientific form which they
assume in Mr. Mill's ⁴ Experimental Methods.’ To assist the student in
this task, l extract the following passages from one of the notes in my
Inductive Logic (ch. 3, Appended Note r, 3rd Ed, pp. 207-9):

‘lf the “Instantiae convenientes in natura calidi '¹ were so related to
one another that, besides the given phenomenon (beat), only one other
circumstance were common to them all, that other circumstance might be
regarded, with more or less probability, as the cause (or effect) of heat, or,
at least, as connected with it through some fact of causation. Such in·
stances would then come under the Method of Agreement.

‘lf one instance in the Table of Agreement (“ Instantiae convenientes irr
natura calidi ”) were so related to one of the instances in the Table of
Privation (“ instantiae in proximo, quae privantur natura calidi '') as to
bave every circumstance irr common with it, except that the former,
besides presenting the phenomenon of beat which is supposed to be absent
in the latter, also presented some other circumstance which was absent
' from the latter, this other circumstance would be the cause, or a necessary
part of the cause (or effect), of beat. We should here have the Method of
Differenee.

‘lf, in the “Tabula graduum, sive comparativae in calido '¹ we could
discover some one phenomenon which increased or diminished propor·
tionately with the increase or diminution of beat, that phenomenon would
be the cause or the effect of beat, or, at least, connected with it through
some fact of causation, and would conform to the requirements of the
Method of Concomitant Variations. lf it could be shown that this pheno-
menon and beat were the only circumstances which van'ed concurrently,
then the phenomenon would be proved to be either· the cause or the effect
of beat, and would conform to the requirements of the rider to this last
Method' (given irr inductive Logic, p. 182).

‘The “Exemplum exclusivae, sive rejectionis naturarum a forma calidi ’⁹
bears some, though, it must be acknowledged, a very slight, resemblance to
the Metbod of Residues. These “ rejectiones ” consist in excluding some
possible explanation of the phenomenon, either· because an instance, which
does not present the phenomenon, does present the assigned cause, or
because an instance, which does present the phenomenon, does not pre·
sent the assigned cause. As arr instance of the former, we may talre the
following “ rejectio ”2 “ Per radios lunae (which were then supposed to be
cold) et aliarum stellarum rejice lucem et lumen.” As instances of the
latter, we may take the two following: “Per radios solis, rejice naturam
elementarem (that is, “ terrestrial nature,'’ which is composed of “the four
