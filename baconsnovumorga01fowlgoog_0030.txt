Novum organum), and founded on a previous work, written in
English and publishcd in 1605, entitled, Of the Proficience and
Advaucement of Learning. When the latter work was written,
Bacon had probably not yet matured his conception of the Great
Instauration. There is a fragment of a work on the same subject,
intennediate in date between these two, first published by Gruter
in 1653, entitled Descriptio Globi intellectualis. This tract, which
may be referred to about the year 1612, was designed on a larger
scale than either of the two already referred to. The part worked out
is mainly on Astronorny, and appended to it isanother tract, entitled
Thema Coeli, givinga provisional account of Bacon’s own astrono-
. micel views, and evidently forming part of the same work. Por-
tions of the tract entitled Valerius Terminus, referred to in the last
paragraph, also go over the same ground as the Advancement and
the De fingmentis.

The second part of the Great instauration, or the proper method
of interpreting Nature, was evidently the one to which Bacon
attached the greatest importance. lt is mainly represented by the
Novum Organum, though preliminary drafts of portione of this work
are to be found in parts of the Valerius Terminus and in the
Partis Secundae Delineatio‚ the Cogitata et Visa, the Temporis Partus
Masculus, and the Filum Labyrinthi sive Inquisitio Legitima de Motu,
to say nothing of smaller pieces, such as De interpretatione Naturae
Sententiae Duodecim, &c The scheme of the Valerius Terminus
does not appear to extend beyond the first and second parts of the
Great Instauration, and another peculiarity is that what in the No-
vum Organum is called the investigation of the form is there (ch. ιι)
called the freeing of a direction. In the Partis Secundae Delineatio
we bave, as already noticed, the first intimation of the six parts of‘
the Great Instauration, but neither there nor in Valerius Terminus
does the idea yet seem to have occurred to Bacon of setting forth
his meaning mainly by means of an example. This plan is an-
nounced at the end of the Cogitata et Visa ⁷, and is worked out
in the second book of the Novum Organum. On the other hand,

'‘Atque diu et acriter rem cogitanti et perpendenti, ante omnia visum est

Labyrinthi‚ sive Inquisitio Legitima de Motu, printed by lillis and Speoding in
vol. iii. p. 6³1, &a This piece is followed in Ellis and Spedding's Edition by a
rough and imperfect draught of amenquiry on Hcat and Cold, written probably iu

1608.
