At rursus multitudinem aut fractiones nemo reformidet ⁴⁹. ln
rebus enim, quae per numeros transiguntur, tam facile quis
posuerit aut cogitaverit millenarium, quarn unum3 aut mille-
simam partem unius quam unum integrum.

Ex duobus generibus axiomatum, quae superius posita
sunt ⁵⁰, oritur vera divisio philosophiae et scientiarum trans-
latis vocabulis receptis (quae ad indicationem rei proxime
accedunt) ad sensum nostrum. Videlicet, ut inquisitio sor-
mamm, quae sunt (ratione certe, et sua lege 61) aeternae et
immobiles, constituat metaphysicam⁵²; inquisitio vero effici-
entis, et materiae, et latentis processus, et latentis schema-
tismi (quae omnia cursum naturae communem et ordinarium,
non leges fundamentales et aeternas respiciunt ⁵³) consti-
tuat physicam: atque his subordinentur similiter practicae
duae3 physicae mechanica ,· nietaplrysicas (perpurgato nomine)

‘simple natures' which are to be found in any given substance, or are
requisite to its productim, and, perhaps, also the several proportions in
which they are combined.

‘⁹ This sentence does not appear to mean more than that in Mathema-
tics we may have to deal with very large or very small quantities. There
may possibly be an allusion to a curious passage in the Republic of Plato
(bk. vii. p. 525 E), where Socrates says that the arithmetician will not
tolerate fractions, but insists on multiplying them baclr again into integers.

⁶⁰ See Aph. 5.

⁶¹ ‘Meanlng,' says Mr. Ellis, ‘that God could change them, but that this
change would be above reason and a change of the law of the form, other·
wise unchangeable.'

⁶² Cp. De Augmentis‚ iii. 4. There he includes the investigation of Final
Causes under Metaphysic. Here, as they stand in no relation to the pre-
sent discussion, he omits all mention of them.

lt is, perhaps, needless to observe that this is a special and arbitrary use
of the word ‘Metaphysic.' The word, as l have already pointed out (Bk.
i. Aph. 63. n. 30), originated as a designation of the books constituting
acertain treatise of Aristotle (τὰ μετὰ τὰ φυσικά), which was regarded by
those who arranged Aristotle’s works as a sort of appendix to the Physics.
On the various and often contradictory meanings which it has subsequently
borne, lt would be beside my purpose to spealr.

⁶³ ln this Aphorism, it would be difficult to say whether ‘forms’ are
used in the sense of ‘laws’ or ‘essences.' Bacon probably had no clear
perception of the distinction between the two ideas.
