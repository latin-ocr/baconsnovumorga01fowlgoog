antiquated or worthless⁴². But, as I have expressed mysell sully
in the notes on the various details ol Bacon's method in the order
in which they occur in the text, it is unnecessary that 1 should here
do more than make a few very briei and general remarks.

Bacon was undoubtedly inclined to underrate the syllogism‚ that is to

say, deductiva reasoning, but then vve must recollect that he regarded
it as his special province to bring out the other side ol reasoning the
inductiva branch by which general principles are established rather
thau applied. Nor would it be true to say that he ignored the deduc-
tive side ol reasoning altogether. Whenever he saw, as he often did see,
its value for the purpose of applying the truths already arrived at by
induction‚ he seems without hesitation to have assigned it a coordinata
rank. Witness, amongst many others, the following passages: ‘Maiora
vero speranda a nova luce axiomatum, ex particularibus illis certa via
et regula eductorum, quae rursus nova particularia indicent et de·
signent. Neque enim in plano via sita est, sed ascendendo et descen-
dendo; ascendendo primo ad axiomata, descendendo ad opera ⁴³!
‘Mathematica philosophiam naluralem terminare* * * * debet ⁴⁴.'
The seventh ol the ‘reliqua auxilia intellectus' (Nov. Org. ii. ar)
which were to succeed the Tables, was to be entitled ‘Deductio ad
Praxin.'
, The charge against Bacon of having, to a certain extent, detracted
srorn the value oi his method by depreciating hypothesis and neglect·
ing to lay down rules lor its legitimare employment, must undoubtedly
be admitted. But theu we may plead in extenuation his admission,
however inconsistent, os hypothesis (⁴ Permissio Intellectus ’) in ii. ao,
as also i. 106, and the gross license with which, both in his time and
ior some time afterwards, this procedure was employed. If Bacon
is to be censured in this particular, as he undoubtedly is to be, the
censure ought in all laimess to be extended to Newton as well.

The method, recommended by Bacon, ol gradual ascent from
particular facts, through axioma of successive degrees of generality‚ up
to the highest generalisations of all⁴⁶, though not,as1 conceive, tbe

⁴² Not to mentipn Liebigand Bacon's prosessed adversaries, we find even Remusat
saying (p. 254i: ‘Bacon n'a point rectilis ou remplace les notions regnes qu'il
condemna, ou ces conceptions scientifiques des choses, sans lesquelles toute recherche
marche au hasard. Ainsi point de recette sure, point de methode insaillible, et le
peu d’usage que l'on a sait das formes techniques d'investigatiou qu'il recommaude
en re d lutilite sort suspecte'
