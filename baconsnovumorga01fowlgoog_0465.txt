Ex iis, quae ante dicta sunt, patet quod quinque illa in·
stantiarum genera de quibus diximus (viz. instantiarum can·
formium, instantiarum monadicamm, instantiarum devian-
tium, instantiarum limitanearnm, instantiarum potestatis) non
debeant reservari, donec inquiratur natura aliqua certa (quem-
admodum instantiae reliquae, quas primo loco proposuimus,

necnon plurimae ex iis quae sequentur, reservari debent);
sed statim jam ab initio facienda est earum collectio, tanquam
historia quaedam particularis; eo quod digerant ea quae in·
grediuntur intellectum, et corrigant pravam complexionem
intellectus ipsius, quem omnino necesse est imbui et infici
et demum perverti ac distorqueri ab incursibus quotidianis
et consuetis ²⁶.

Chiromancy, may read in his own haud what his correspondent had set
down in bis. For instance, would l in London acquaint my intimate
in Paris, that Iam weit: l would then prick that part where 1 had
appointed the letter [l] and, doing so in another place to signitie that
word was done, proceed to [A] thence to [M] and so on, till 1 bad linbht
what 1 intended to make known!

'‘Then there is a Magnetick way of curiug wouuds by anointing the
weapon, and that the wound is affected iu lilre manner as is the extra·
venate blood by the Sympatbetick medicine, as to matter of fact is with
circumstances os good evidence asserted hythe Noble Sir K. Digby in his
ingenious discourse on the subject. The reason os this magnale he
attempts by Mechanism, and endeavours to malre it out by atomical
aporrheas, which passing from the cruentate cloth or weapon to the
¹ wound, and being incorporated with the particles of the salve carry
them in their embraces to the affected part: where the medicinal atomes
entering together with the effluviums oi the blood, do by their subtle
insinuation better effect the cure, than can be done by any grosser ap·
plication. The particular way of their conveyance, and their regular
direction is handsomely explicated by that learned Knigbt, and recom-
mended to the ingenious by most witty and becoming illustrations. lt
is out of my way here to enquire whether the Anima Mundi be not
a better account than any Mechanical Solutions. The former is more
desperate; the latter perhaps hath more ot ingenuity than good ground
ol satisfaction. lt is enough for me that de sacto there is such an eu·
tercourse between the Magnetick unguent and the vuluerated body, aud
l need not be solicitous oi the cause.’

²⁸ These live instances are regarded rather as fumishing materials ior
a Natural History, and as instrumental in removing prejudices, than as
directly suggesting inductive infereuces. But, as Mr. Kitchin says, it
