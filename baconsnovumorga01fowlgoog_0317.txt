294 NOVUM ORGANUM.

materiam, in memoria integram, sed in intellectu mutatam et
subactam, reponit. ltaque ex harum facultatum (experi-
mentalis scilicet et rationalis) arctiore et sanctiore foedere
(quod adhuc sactum non est) bene sperandum est.

XCVI.

Naturalis philosophia adhuc sincera non invenitur, sed in-
iecta et corrupta: in Aristotelis schola, per logicam ⁸⁹, in
Platonis schola, per theologiam naturalem ⁷⁰3 in secunda
schola ⁷¹ Platonis, Procli, et aliorum, per mathematicam
quae philosophiam naturalem terminare, non generare aut
procreare debet ⁷2. At ex philosophia naturali pura et imper·
mista meliora speranda sunt.

‘⁹ See Aphs. 54, 63, with my notes on them.

⁷⁰ See Aph. ⁶5, with my notes. Cp. also Aph. 48, so iar as it bears on
Final Causea.

⁷¹ Bacon is alluding to the Neoplatouists, though, properly speaking, the
‘secunda schola Platonis' is the New Academy. On the philosophy of the
Neoplatonists, see Zeller or Ueberweg. The slightest knowledge of their
system will shew the justice oi Bacon’s criticisrn.

⁷² Cp. De Augmentis, lib. iii. cap. 6, which the student should read
careiully in connection with this Aphorism. l am inclined to think that
Bacou had conceived, though, perhaps, not very clearly, the true relation
between Physics and Mathematics. The most general axioms of Natural
Philosophy were to he carelully established by induction; then, when
they had been stated in a quantitative form, they were to be combined
with each other, and worked out deductively, by means of mathematica!
calculations, into all their ramifications and applications. lt is needless ,
to add that the magnificent achievements of modern science (witness, ior
instance, the Principia or Opticso of Newton, or the Mecanique Anaiytique
oi Lagrange) have been due at least as much to mathematical calculation
as to inductive generalisation. The more advanced scienees, in fact, l
become,' ιιι their later stages, mainly mathematical. But, while a science
remains iu its earlier, or inductiva, stage, it is only capable of mathematical
treatment, if at all, to a very slight degree. This, for instance, is still the
case with the sciences of chemistry and physiology.

The parallel passage in Bk.1i. Aph. Β (Optime autem cedit inquisitio
naturalis, quando physicum terminatur ιιι mathematico ’), appears to apply
specially to the enumeration and mensuration of the ultimate particles of
matter, as conceived by Bacon. Hence, it might be contended that his
view of the fonctions of Mathematics in the present Aphorismis equally
limited. But 1 am inclined to think that here the remark has a much
wider bearing, and that the office of Mathematics, as contemplated iu ii. 8,

splould be only a special exemplification oi the iunctions here ascribed to
t em. ·
