Doctrina 'enim d'e idolis similiter se habet ad interpretationem
naturae, sicut doctrina de sophisticis elenchis ad dialecticam

'v Idola tribus sunt lundata in ipsa natura humana, atque in
ipsa tribu seu gente hominum ⁴⁸. Falso enim asseritur,
sensum humanum ⁴³ esse mensuram rerum; quin contra,

· ⁴² That is to say, it is Bacon's Doctrina of Fallacies, and its iunction is
to clear the mind oi salse notione, in order that it may be open to the
reception ol true ones.

⁴⁸ Must we then despair oi the possibility of attaining knowledge? We
cannot, indeed, transcend the limitations of our own faculties, or know
things except in relation to our own bodily and mental constitution; but
hy comparing our impressions and inferences‚ one with another, and with
those of other men, and, abore all, by constantly reriewing and connecting
our conceptione by comparison with the facts of Nature, we are able
to detect not only the individual peculiarities oi our own minds but also
the general tendencies to enor which are common to mankind at large.
The mind, though it is beset with phantoms, has not entirely lost the
power of ‹hstinguishing between phantoms aad realities.

⁴⁹ 1f this is meant to represent the dictum of Protagoras, it does so most
inadequately. Protagoras asserted, not that the senses uncontrolled hy
reason, but that man, meaning the human faculties generally, was the
measure of all things. Πάντων χρημάτων μέτρον ἄνθρωπος, τῶν μὲν ὄντων ὡς

’ ἔστι, τῶν δὲ οὐκ ὅντων ὡς οὐκ ἔστιν. Mahing due allowance for the relativity

of human lrl‘lbwledge, that is, understanding the maxim in the sonn,
‘Man is ro marthe measure oi all things,‘ it seems to be not only true but
atruism. And the same may be said of the individual form which the
araxim sometimes takes: ‘Every man is ro himself the measure ol all
things.’ ln the Theaetetus, however, where the Protagorean dictum is
discussed, the theory that Cognition is simply sensible Perception is dis·
eussed also, the two enquiries being confounded, and treated as identical.
That Protagoras never expressly asserted the latter proposition is almost
certain. ‘lt is not improbable,’ says Mr. Grote, ‘that the three doctrines'
(namely, that man is the measure of all things, that Cognition is sensible
Perception, and that Nature consists in a perpetual motion, change, or
flux), ‘here put together by Plato and subjected to a common scrutiny,
may have been sometimes held hythe same philosophare. Nevertheless,
the language ol Plato himself shews us that Protagoras never expressly
affirmed knowledge to he sensible Perception: and that the substantial
identity between this doctrine, and the different doctrine maintained hy
Protagoras, is to be regarded asa construction put upon the two by Plato'
The student has already, in a previous note, been referred to Mr. Grote’s
admirable criticism of the Theaetetus, where the Protagorean dictum, in
its various relations, is discussed at great leng'h and with much acuteness.
That the senses alone are competent to lurnish knowledge, without any-
