22 INTRODUCTION.

e'undemque Deum luisse, qui creaturis leges illas Naturae, hominibus
vero legem Christianam dedisset ³⁹:

Itis a remark very characteristic oi Bacon's point 'oi view that the
superiority ol the public to the private good determines the contro·
versy as to the relative advantages of the practical- and contemplative
lite in favour ol the former. For the reasons, he says, adduced by
Aristotle in favour of the latter have respect only to private good
and the pleasure or dignity of the individual. Nor, it the monastic
lite had been regarded as merely and strictly contemplative, could any
doubt on this question have ever an'sen in the church: ‘Contempla-
tivam vero quod attinet meram, et in seipsa terminatam, quaeque
radios nullos sive caloris sive luminis in societatem humanam diffundat ;
nescit earn certe Theologia⁴⁰.'

ln concluding this section, 1 must again remind the reader that
Bacon's merit does not consist in his philosophical teaching in the
proper sense ol the term, but in his assertion ol the necessity oi a
new ,methodos a new range of studies, oi a new spirit of enquiry.
He was a logician, in the widest aud sullest sense os the word.
A philosopher he did not claim to be3 and thoughl believe that
his worlrs exerted a very powerlul influence on the philosophical
speculations of the two succeeding centuries, a philosopher, in the
strict sense of the term, he was not.

Of the many charges brought against Bacon, as a philosopher y
and a reformer of science, there are three, connected with the present
subject, which it would be vain to deny, though, in the course oi
this enquiry, we may find something to plead in extenuation os them.
The first is that he was a Dilettante in science. The second, that
he was imperfectly acquainted with the existing state of knowledge.
The third, that he grossly exaggerated the defects oi his own time,

which, in spite os all that be says, was really one os great and
fruitful intellectual activity. ¹
