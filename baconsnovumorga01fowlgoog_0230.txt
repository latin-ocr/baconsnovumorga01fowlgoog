scepticism of the former as the less thorough-going of the two, but not
for the reason ordinarily assigned. The philosophers of the New Academy,
he supposes, differed, in general, from the Sceptics, tn not making ἀταραξία
the supreme end of philosophy, and, furthermore, in admitting a theory
of probability, which serwed as a practical gulde of life.

This theory of probability recognises three grades. They are derived re-
spectively from (ι) φαντασία πιθανὴ, our first impression of an object;
(a) φαντασία πιθανὴ ἅμα καὶ ἀπερισπαστός, rhe concurrent testimony of our
various impressions; (3) φαντασία <impioranris καὶ διεξωδευμένη, the same
concurrent testimony, when thoroughly sifted and examined by the reason.
The hIghest degree of probability takes the place of certaInty in other
systema. Bacon alludes to the Academia theory of probability ln Aph. 67.

⁴² lt will be noticed that Bacon opposes to the ‘nihil sciri posse' of
the New Academy ‘non multum seiri posse,' that he interpolates ‘in
natura,’ and to ‘simpliciter’ opposes ‘ea, quae nunc in usu est, via! ‘ ln
natura' must not be taken as fmplying that he thought the old method
sufficient for the moral and politIcal selences. See note on Aphorism ²9·

The contrast which Bacon here draws between himself and the philo-
sophers of the New Academy can hardly fail to remind us of the similar
contrast which has frequently been drawn between Socrates and the
leading Sophists of his tlme. The method of Socrates began ln scepticism,
but its object was to re·establish the foundations of knowledge. Similarly,
Bacon attempts to destroy the credit of the old method of enqulry, only
that he may replace it by anew and surer one. There is a passage in
the De Augmentis (bh. i.) in which he says, if not truly, at least finely:
‘if we begIn with certainties, we shall end in doubts; but if we begin
with doubts, andare patient ln them, we shall end in certainties’

⁴³ Here commences tbe doctrine of the Idola, which Is, perhaps, the
best-known, as it is, certainly, one of the most important parts of the
Novum Organum. On the meaning of the word ‘Idola' see the first
note on Aph. ²3· Mr. Ellis draws attention to the various forms in
which this doctrine appears in Bacon’s different worhs, but a still more
accurate and elaborate account of the changes is given in a note by
Mr. Spedding. See Ellis and SpeddIng’s Bacon, vol. i. pp. 89-93, and
Note C (by Mr. Speddmg), pp. 113·1¹7· To these the reader who may
wish for more iuformation on the subject is referred. lt is suffictent here
to state that the Idols in their earlier form (as they appear in the English
