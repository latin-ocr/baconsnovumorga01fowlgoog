school of English philosophy. As, however, 1 have discussed this
question in the sections on the Influence and Value of Bacon's
writings, it is unnecessary that Ι should also dwell upon it here. lt ¹
may be enough to say that, like Socrates, he rather gave an impulse ,
and suggested lines of thought to others, than elaborated a definite
system of his own.

But, at the same time, it is interesting to ask what the opinions of
Bacon were, so far as we can gather them, on the controverted quesn
tions of psychology, ontology, and ethics. Now, as to what, for want
of a better name, may be called ontological or metaphysical questions,
the questions, namely, which relate to the origin and essential nature
of matter and mind, and the relation between the tiro, his ordinary
attitude is that of a disinterested, if not a contemptuouS, silence.
The passage just cited proceeds as follows: ‘Neque enim hoc agimus;
neque etiam multum interesse putamus ad hominurn fortunas quales
quis opiniones abstractas de natura et rerum principiis habeat; neque
dubium est, quin multa hujusmodi et vetera revocari et nova introduci
possint ; quemadmodum et complura themata coeli supponi possunt,
quae cum phoenomenis sat bene conveniunt, inter se tamen dissen-
tiunt! Adcep sense of thc unprofitable character of these specula-
tions has, indeed, been a characteristic not of the Baconian philosophy
only, but ofBritish philosophy in general, which, witha healthy instinct,
has usually either avoided them altogether or discussed thern solely with
the view of shewing that they lie outside the limits of human knowledge. ;
An apparent exception ia, perhaps, to be found in Bacon’s constant re-
currence to the doctrines of the Atomists‚ as to the atoms and the void.
But these, properly speaking, are questions of physice rather than of
uretaphysics On the standing feud between what are, somewhat
uncouthly, called the Idealists, the Materialists, and the Dualists, there
is, so far asI am aware, no formal discussion in Bacon's writings,
unless we count the passage in the De Principiis atque Originibus
(E. and S.,v01. iii. p. 110), in which, quite sincerely as I believe, he
adopts the scriptural doctrine of creation out of nothing by the omni·
potent power of God. ‘Tria enim videntur esse dogmata quae
scimus ex fide circa hanc rem. Primo, quod materia creata sit ex
nihilo. Secund0, quod eductio systematis fuerit perverbum omni·
potentiae, neque quod materia se ipsa eduxerit e chao in schema-
tismum illum. Tertio, quod schematismus ille (ante praevaricationem)
fuerit optimus ex iis quae materia (qualis creata crat) suscipere posset.
ht philosophiae illae ad nullum horum adscendere potuerunt. * * * *
ln his itaque filei atque ejus firmamentis standum!
