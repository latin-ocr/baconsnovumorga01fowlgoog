Sicut scientiae ¹², quae nunc habentur, inutiles sunt ad in-
ventionem operum3 ita et logica, quae nunc habetur, inutilis
est ad inventionem scientiarum,

To the same effect we find a passage in Galileo’s Dialogo dei Massimi
Sistemi, Giornata Pn'ma (Sir Thomas Salusbury’s Translation, pp. 84, 85) :

Sagredus. ‘l ever accounted extraordinary madness that oi those who
would make human comprehension the measure of what nature batha
power or knowledge to effect3 whereas on the contrary there is not any
the least effect in Nature, which can be iully understood by the most
speculative wits in the world. This their so vain presumption of knowing·
all, can take beginning from nothing, unless from their never having known
anything; for if one bath but once only experienced the perfect knowledge
of one only thing, and but truly tasted what it is to know, be shall perceive
that of infinite other conclusions, be understauds not so much as one!

¹⁰ A post-classical word. '‘Controversies! Du Gange, explains it as
‘ Lis, controversia, placitum,’ and, amongst other authorities, quotes Gregor.
Magn. lib. i. epist. 9: ‘F ines, de quibus causatio mota est;' Concilium
Arelatense, an. 813. can. 16: ‘Ne in Dominicis diebus publicae mercatae,
neque causationes disceptationesque exerceantur! ‚

The* word occurs in the sense of an ‘excuse’ or ‘apology' as early
as the time of Aulus Gellius (‘Atque id fecerunt ne causatio ista aegri
corporis perpetuam vacationem daret fidem detrectantibus, jurisque ac·
tiones declinantibus,’ Noctes Atticae, lib. xx. cap. 1), but that does not
seem to be its meaning in this place.

¹¹ We cannot place ourselves sufficiently apart from the crowd in which
we move, to obtain anything like an adequate idea of its eccentricities and
delusions.

¹² Aphorisms xi-xiv should be considered in connection with each
other. They contain the sum of Bacon's complaint against the old logie.
Though the scholastic logic recognised lnduction as a form of reasoning
it failed to see its importance, and bad not attempted to lay down any
rules forits employment. Hence, practically, it was exclusively a syllo-
gistic logie. Now it is the function of syllogism to develope the con·
sequences oi a principle, not to examine the principle itself. But, unless
we examine the principle, how can we be certain of the truth of the
consequences? We may only be multiplying error instead of truth. The
conclusion oi every new syllogism may be only one error tbe more, and,
from the false confidence which the mere reiteration of a proposition
begets in the mind, a principle which at first was received with hesitation
may corne to be regarded as unassailable, and be assumed as placed beyond
all doubt. When men have reared a vast superstructure of reasoning‚

they are naturally unwilling to examine the foundations. What is
