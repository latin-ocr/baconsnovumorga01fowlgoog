INTRODUCTION. 21

the subsequent development ol Moral Philosophy in England will
not lail to find in this sentence the germ ol one of the leading ideas
in the systems os Shaltesbury, Hutcheson, and so many other English
writers.

With the more minute divisione of Good, and with the details oi
Bacon's moral system generally, 1 need not trouble the· reader, who
can easily consult this part os the De Augmentis lor himself.

There are, however, one or two points which deserte special
notice. Thus, Bacon, like all other English writers, down, 1 believe,
to the time ol Hohbes, makes morality ultimately dependent on
theology. Ethics is the hand-maid os theology, and, though it may
contain much uselul instruction within its own limits, it must always
be subservierit to the master-science. ‘Quod si quis objiciat ani·
morum¹ curationem Theologiae Sacrae munus esse, verissimum est
qnod asserit3 attamen Philosophiam Moralem in famulitium Theolo-
giae recipi instar ancillae prudentis et pedissequae fidelis, quae ad
omnes ejus nutus praesto sit et ministret, quid prohibeat? Etenim
quemadmodum in Psalmo habetur, quod oculi ancellae perpetuo ad
manus domairac respicientem tamen minime dubium sit, quin haud
pauca ancillae judicio et curae relinquantur; eodem modo et Ethica
obsequium Theologiae omnino praestare debet, ejusque praeceptis
morigera esse; ita tamen ut et ipsa, intra suos limites, haud pauca
sana et utilia documenta continere possit δ”] Ol course, this point ol
view is hardly consistent with the comprehension ol ethics under the
sciences admitting ol an inductive treatment ³³, but, then, at this
stage in the history ol ethical thought, we must not expect eon·
sistency, except in writers, lilre HohbeS, who had devoted special
attention to the ultimate grounds ol moral and political ideas. An in-
consistency of another kind may be sound in Bacon’s anxiety to liberate
natural philosophy srom the control of theology‚ notwithstanding
his readiness to subordinate to that science moral philosophy and, as
we have seen, even a portion ol psychology.

It may be noticed also that Bacon finds a special argument t'or the
divine origin ol the Christian religion in its marked preference of the
cbmmon to the individual good. ‘Nulla omnibus saeculis reperta
est vel philosophia vel secta vel religio vel lex aut disciplina, quae in
tantum Communionis Bonum exaltavit, Bonum vero individuale de-
pressit, quantum Sancta Fides Christiana; unde liquido pateat unum
