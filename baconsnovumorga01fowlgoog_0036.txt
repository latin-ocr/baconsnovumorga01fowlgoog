but little engaged in business, Bacon‚ ii not already actually appointed
Solicitor General¹⁸‚ was using all his influence to obtain the office,
and was certainly recognised‚ on all sides, as amongst the ioremost
men both at the Bar and in Parliament. How little idea Liebig could
have had ol the pressure oi public life in England, oi the nature
oi the office ¹os Solicitor General, or os the state 01 public business
at this time, it is quite unnecessary ior me to point out to any
English reader. Moreover‚ Bacon's mind was already tull of his
philosophical projects and os the great revolution which 111 was to
accomplish in the study os nature. Was it likely that he would waste his
time in turning into Latin a work which already existed in English?

Such is the exceedingly slender character os the negative evidence
on which we are required to accept the very sweeping assertion‚
that Bacon could not write Latin and that all his works were
originally composed in English!

But, with respect to the Novum Organum, it happens that we
possess positive evidence to the contrary. Archbishop Tenison
(writing in 1678) states distinctly: ‘The Second Part oi his Great
Instauration (and so considerable apart of it, that the name oi the whole
is given to loistris Novum Organum Scientiarum, written by himself
in the Latin Tongue¹⁷.' And, to make this evidence the more
weighty, it comes immediately aster a description of the negotiations
between Bacon and Playier about the translation oi the Advancement
oi Leaming, and a criticism of the translation 01 that work, as
actually made by Dr. Gilbert Wats. The evidence oi Tenison I
regard as almost conclusive, but it is as well, perhaps, to mention one
or two subsidiary arguments. Hume (History oi England, vol. vi.
p. 191) states, in a criticism oi Bacon’s style, which shews how
partial and superficial such judgments ordinarily are: ‘Most oi his
performances were composed in Latin; though he possessed neither
the elegance of that, nor oi his native tongue.' Nor, till the time
of Liebig (who certainly had no special means os knowledge), am
1 aware that any one ever questioned the Latin composition os the
Novum Organum as well as oi several of Bacon’s other works.

Then, as M. Bouillet remarks, many oi the fragments and smaller

¹⁸ Bacon was finally, aiter much delay in filling up the appointment, made
Solicitor General on June 25, 1607. Playser died. Feb. a, 1608-9. The letter ol
Bacou to Playier was, according to Mr. Spedding, ‘certainly written ⁸¹ somewhile ''
after November 1605, when the Advancement of Leaming was published (¹a good
while since) according to Bacon himself), and certainly not alter July 1608:
