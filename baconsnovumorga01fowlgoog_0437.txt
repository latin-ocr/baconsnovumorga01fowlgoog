in concreto, fit ut alia aliam retundat, deprimat, frangat, et
liget3 unde obscurantur formae singulae. Inveniuntur autern
subjecta nonnulla in quibus natura inquisita prae aliis est in
suo vigore, vel per absentiam impedimenti vel per praedomi-
nantiam virtutis. Huiusmodi autem instantiae sunt maxime
ostensione formae. Verum et in his ipsis instantiis adhibenda
est cautio, et cohibendus impetus intellectus ⁴⁹. Quicquid enim

. ‘⁹ Cp. i. 47. There is sometimes a danger lest these ‘glaring instances’
should produce an undue effect on the mind, to the prejudice of other
instances less striking, but, perhaps, equally or more instructive3 and
hence the need of cantion. This is all that Bacon seems to mean.

⁶⁰ ln Aph. 20, ‘motus expansivus’ is given as the ‘prima differentia'
of heat.

⁶¹ The thermometer, as exhibiting the expansive power of heat, is a
good example of a glaring instance. l add some others.

‘lf the weight of the air were inquired into, the Torricellian experi-
ment, or the barometer, affords an ostensive instance, where the circum·
stance which conceals the weight of the atmosphere in common cases,
nameiy, the pressure of it in all directions, being entirely removed, that
weight produces its full effect, and sustains the whole column of mercury
in the tube. The barometer aflords also an example of the instants'a
migrans, when the change is not total, but only partini or progressive.
lf it be the weight of the air which supports the mercury in the tube
of the barometer, when that weight is diminished, the mercury ought
to stand lower. On going to the top of a mountain, the weight of the
incumbent air is diminished, because a shorter column of air is to be
sustained; the mercury in the barometer ought therefore to sink, and it
is found to do so accordingly.

‘These are instances in which the action of certain principles is reu·
dered visible by the removal of all the opposing forces. One may be
given where it is the distinct and decisive nature of this fact which leads
to the result.

‘Suppose it were inquired, whether the present land had ever been
covered by the sea. lf we look at the stratiiied form of so large a portion
of the earth’s surface, we cannot but conclude it to be very probable that
such land was formed at the bottorn of the sea. But the decisive proof
is afforded by the shells and corais, or bodies having the perfect shape
of shells aud corals and of other marine exuviae, which arc found im·
