made with the view oi leading up to larger inductions, or afterwards
employed for that purpose. Notice the expressions ‘tauquam formam
minorem‚’ ‘formae particulares,’ dcc.

“⁴ Collective instances,’' ’ says Sir John Herschel, ‘in Bacon’s classifica·
tion, are no other than general facts, or laws oi some degree of generallty,
andare themselves the results oi induction. But there is a species of
collective instance which Bacon does not seem to have contemplated, of a
peculiarly instructive character; and that is, where particular cases are
offered to our observation in such numbers at once as to make the induc·
tion of their law a matter of ocular inspection. For example, the parabottc
form assumed by a jet oi water spouted from a round hoie, is a collecriee
instance oi the velocities and directions oi the motions ol all the particles
which compose it seen at once, thus leading us, without trouble, to
recognise the law of the motion ofa projectlle. Again‚ the beautiful
ligures exhibited by sand strewed on regular plates os glass or metal set in
vibration, are collective instances of an infinite number oi points which
remaln at rest while the remainder of the plate vibrates; and in con·
sequence afford u5‚ as it were, a sight ol the law which regulates their
arrangement and sequence throughout the whole suriace. The beautifully
coloured lemniscates seen around the optio axes of crystals exposed to
polarised light afford a superb example of the same kind, pointing at once
to the general mathematical expression of the law which regulates their
productiori. (See Phil. Trans. 1819.) Ol such collective instances as these,
it is easy to see the importance‚ and its reason. They lead usto a general
law by an induction which offers itself spontaneously‚ and thus furnish ad·
vanced points in our enquiries; and when we start t'rom these, already “a
thousand steps are tost.” .

⁴ A fine example ol a collective instance is that of the systern of Jupiter
or Saturn with its satellites. We have here, in miniature, and seen at
one view a system similar to that of the planels about the sun; of which,
from the circumstance of our being involved in it, and unlavourably
situatcd for seeing it otherwise than in detail, we are incapacitated from
forming a general idea but by slow progressive efforts of reason. Accord-
ingly, the contemplation of the circumjcvial planets (as they were called)
· most materially assisted in securing the admission of the Coperuican sys-
tem! Discourse, dcc„ ἑὸ 194-5.
