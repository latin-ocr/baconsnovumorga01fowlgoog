200 NOVUM ORGANUM.

XXIII.

Non leve quiddam interest inter humanae mentis idolam,
et divinae mentis ideas ²⁹3 hoc est, inter placita quaedam
inania, et veras signaturas atque impressiones factas in crea·
turis, prout inveniuntur.

XXIV.

Nullo modo fieri potest, ut axiomata per argumentationem

qualities ln nature were composed. For the further explanation of these
‘ F orms,’ the student must refer to the Introducti0u.

Mr. Spedding notices that, iu his English writiugs, Bacon seems to use
the word ‘origiual’ as equivaleut to ‘naturae notior.¹

lt is interestIng to compare with this Aphorism the following passage
of the DistributIo Operis: ‘At secundum nos, axiomata contiuenter et
gradatim excitantur, ut nonnisi postremo loc'o ad generalissima veniatur:
ea vero generalissima evadunt nou notionalla, sed bene tennInata, et talia
quae natura ut revera sibi notiora agnoscat, quaeque rebus haereant iu
medullis!

’Β εἴδωλα, ‘ phantoms’ or ‘spectres,' not ‘idols’ iu the sense of false gods,
as several writers have interpreted it. lu the De Augmentis, lib. v. cap. 4,
they are called Imagines sive idola, and in the second of the Two Boolrs
on the Advaucement of Leaming, published in 1605, they are spoken of
as ‘false appearances that are imposed upon us’ by ‘the general nature
of the miud,’ by ‘words' etc. For the latter passage, see Ellis and
Spedding’s Edition of Bacon’s Works, vol. iil. pp. 394·7· Mr. Hailam
(Literature of Europe, part ili. ch. 3. § 60) gives some amusing extracts
from the authors who have mistaken the meanIng of the word.

²⁹ Are these ‘ideas of the divise mind' the ·‘ forms' of which Bacon
will speak hereafteri That God created all things ln conformity with
certain ideas, forms, or exemplars ln hIs own mind, as the sculptor fashious
astatue, and that thus, ln a certam sense, the world had a pre-existence
iu the mind of God, isa commonplace of philosophy and theology. Cp.
Campanella, Metaphysica, pars i. lib. i. Prooemium: ‘Propterea nil est
in mundo, quod non aliquid in mente Dei lateus idealiter exprimat?
One, though probably not the true, interpretation oi the Ideal doctrine
of Plato is that the ἴδιαι are slmply the ideas or typical forms existIng
iu the mind of God.

By the concluding words of the Aphorism, Bacon probably Intends to
intimate, as Mr. KitchIn says, ‘that it would be futile for Man to en·
deavour to contemplate any thing abstracted from, and out of its
connection with, the material world,' that, in fact, our only mode of
ascertainIng the ideas of the divtne mind is the patIeut study of the
Book of Nature. The Aphorism might be paraphrasecl thus: God is
omniscient3 Nature is the reflection of the miud of God. Man, led
astray by the phantasms in his own mind, has vainly imagined that he
can attain to knowledge, without gotng to Nature and therela srudying
the image os the divine mind. Cp. Aph. 124.
