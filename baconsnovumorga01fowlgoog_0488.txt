demum stellato sit velocissimus: tum certe re'cipi debet motus
diurnus pro vero in coelis, et abnegandus est motus terrae;
quia manifestum erit, motum ab oriente in occidentem esse
plane cosmicum etex consensu universi, qui in summitatibus
coeli maxime rapidus gradatim labascat, et tandem desinat
et extinguatur in immobili, videlicet terra⁸⁶.

⁸³ if the heavens revolved with an uniform motion round the earth, it is
plain that the more remote a point is from the earth, the more rapid would
be its motion. But, suppose the earth to revolve on its axis, we should
have exactly the same set of appearances as on the former supposition,
and, if we were ignorant of the fact of the earth’s rotation, we should
imagine a distant point to move with much greater rapidity than a point
which is near. Hence the conditions of this so-called Crucial lustauce,
even if satislied, would equally well suit either hypothesis. But they are
evidently complicated by the consideration of the proper motions of the
planets and comets.

Dr. Whewell, who comments at some length on this example (History
of the Inductive Sciences, 3rd Ed, Additious, vol. i. pp. 388-390), adduces
it as shewing that Bacon, at least in his later years, was not so much
opposed, as is commonly thought, to the Copernicau theory. ‘With
regard to the diurual motion of the earth: he says, ‘it would seem as
if Bacon himself had a leaning to believe it when be wrote this passage3
for neither is he himself, nor are any of the Anti-Copernicans, accustomed
to essert that the immensely rapid motion of the sphere of the Fixed Stars
graduates bya slower and slower motion of Planets, Comets, hir and
Ocean, into the immobility of the Earth. So that the conditione are not
satisfied ou which he hypothetically says, “tum abnegandus est motus
terrae.”' l must confess, however, that l cannot take so favourable a
view. See Aph. 46, where, speaking of the enormous velocity impiied by
the diurnal motion of the heavens, he says, ‘quae etiarn viros graves ita
obstupefecit, ut mallent credere motum terrae: evidently regarded as an
extreme supposition. Cp. also the end of the next paragraph of that
Aphorism, and Aph. 35, where, iu discussing rest and motion, he says,
‘statim sive quies, videtur competere globo ipsi terrae?

ln the Introduction, Section 6, Bacon’s altitude· to the Copernicau
theoryis discussed at some length. We must, of course, distinguish the
passages in which he speaks of the diurnal from those in which he speaks
of the annual motion of the earth. But that Whewell’s argument, aa
derived from the passage iu the text, is delusive, is plain from comparing a
corresponding passage in the De F luxu et Refluxu Maris (E. and 8., vol. iii.
p. 53), where Bacon states dogmatically that it is an invariable rule that,
the nearer a body approaches the earth, the slower is its motion of
rotation.

lt may be worth noticing that Telesius (De Rerum Natura, i. 3) insists
ou the motiones the air, testing the position partly ou authority aad
