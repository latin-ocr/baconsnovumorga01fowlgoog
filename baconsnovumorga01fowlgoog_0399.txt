dissolutionibus. Itaque gradus caloris in inanimatis, quatenus
ad tactum humanum, nullus est; veruntamen illa gradu frigoris
differunt3 non enim aeque frigidum est lignum ac metallum.
Sed hoc pertinet ad Tabulam Graduum ire Frigido.

2. Attamen quoad potentiales calores et praeparationes ad
flammam, complura inveniuntur inanimata admodum dispo·
sita, ut sulphur, naphtha, petrelaeum ³2.

3. Quae antea incaluerunt, ut fimus equinus ex animali, aut
calx, aut fortasse cinis aut fuligo ex igne, reliquias latentes
quasdam caloris prioris retinent ³³. Itaque fiunt quaedam dis-
tillationes et separationes corporum per sepulturam in fimo
equino ; atque excitatur calor in calce per aspersionem aquae;
ut jamdictum est.

4. Inter vegetabilia non invenitur aliqua planta sive pars
plantae (veluti lachryma aut medulla) quac sit ad tactum
humanum calida. Sed tamen (ut superius dictum est) herbae
virides conclusae calescunt; atque ad interiorem tactum,
veluti ad palatum aut ad stomachum aut etiam ari exteriores
partes, post aliquam moram (ut in emplastris et unguentis)
alia vegetabilia inveniuntur calida, alia frigida ³⁴.

⁸¹ Petroleum.

⁸³ This idea is, of course, purely fantastic. By analogy, steel or glass
ought to be peculiarly susceptible oi heat, because they have been passed
through the fornace.

³¹ This confusion between things which are hot, in the true sense oi
having a high degree oi temperature, and those which affect any of our
organs with a sensation akin to that of heat, has already been pointed
out in note ⁶5 on Aph. 11. Sir John Herschel’s remarks (Discourse on
the study of Natural Philosophy, § 345) on this and similar confusions
apply to so many of Bacon’s examples that l think it will be useful to
the student if l extract them at length:

‘The word heat generally implies the sensation which we experience
on approaching a fire3 but, in the sense it carries in physics, it denotes
the cause, whatever it be, of that sensation, and of all the other phe·
nomena which arise on the applicatiou of fire, or of any other heating
cause. We should be greatly deceived if we referred only to sensatiou
as an indication of the presence of this cause. Many of those things which
excite in our organs, aud especially those of taste, a sensation of beat,
owe this property to chemical stimulants, and not at alito their being
actually hot. This error oi judgrnent has produced a corresponding con·
fusion oi language, and hence had actually at one period crept into physical
philosophy a great many illogical and absurd conclusions. Again, there Ι
