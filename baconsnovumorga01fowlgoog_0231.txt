Quatuor sunt genera idolorum, quae mentes humanas

Treatise on the Advancement 01 Learning) correspoud with those 01 the
Tribe, the Cave, and the Market·Place, 01111 that ‘the oue substantial
change which the doctrine 01 111015 underwent was the admission 01 the
idola Theatri into the company! The doctrine occurs 111 the Valerius
Terminus, the Advancement 01 Leaming, the Temporis Partus Masculus,
thePartis Secundae Delineatio,the DistributioOperis, and the De llugmentis,
but 101 the most perfect treatment 01 11 15 that in the Novum Organum.
On the classilicatlon 01 the ldola 11110 groups 1 shall say something in a
note on the next Aphorism.

11 has 011011 been remarked that the doctrine 01 the ldola was 01111-
cipated by Bacon's great namesake, Roger Bacon, who gives a 10111-10111
classilicatlon 01 ‘offendicula quae omnem quemcunque sapientem im·
pediunt.’ These are unworthy authority, custom, vulgar opinion, 01111
concealment 01 ignorance combined with the ostentation 01 apparent
wisdom. Mr. Ellis, however (vol. 1. pp. 89, 90), argues very justly that
Bacon is not likely to have seen the Opus Majus, which then existed only
in manuscript, and, as Mr. Spedding adds, was probably not procurable,
and possibly even unknown to him ; moreover, the correspondence between
the ‘idola’ and the ‘offendicula’ is very slight. What probably suggested
the idea 01 the one having been horrowed from the other is the 1011110111
division which is common to both, but the ‘idola' as we have seen, were,
in the original 101111 01 the doctrine, enumerated as only three.

Roger Bacon’s statement and refutation 01 the ‘offendicula' will be
sound worked out at great length in the 151 Ρο11 01 the Opus Majus,
and more brielly in the Opus Tertium, cap. 00. Μ1. Spedding has quoted
the opening words 01 the former passage. l will append those 01 the
latter, in which there are some interesting variations:

‘Qatuor vero sunt causae generales omnium malorum nostrorum, et
omnem statum a principio mundi corruperunt, et ornnem hominem quan·
tumcunque sapientem (praeter Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum et
Beatam Virginem) aliquando extra viam rectam, vel extra ultimam per·
sectionem coegerunt declinare. Et sunt fragilis auctoritatis exempla,
consuetudinis diuturnitas, et sensus multitudinis imperitae, atque prae-
sumptio humanae mentis, qua quilibet nititur suae imperitiae solatium
quaerere, et ea, quae nescit, aut 11011 approbare aut reprobare, et illud
modicum quod scit vel aestimat scire, licet nesciat, gaudet imprudenter
ostentare! The rest 01 the chapter (which will be found in Mr. Brewei's

‘ F r. Rogeri Bacon Opera quaedam inedita,’ pp. 69-73) is very curious and
well worth the attention 01 the student.
