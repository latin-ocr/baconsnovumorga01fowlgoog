⁴⁰ Bacon alludes to these monks on two other occasions, namely in the
Historia Vitae et Mortis (E. and 8., vol. ii. p. 131), where he calls them
Foliatani, and iu the sylva sylvarum, Exp. 45, where he calls them
Foliatanes.

1 borrow the following note from Mr. Ellis: ‘Bacon doubtless refers to
the austerities of the order of Feiiillans. Jean de la Baniere, after holding
the Cistercian abbey of Feiiillans in commendam for eleven years, re·
nounced the world in 1573, and in the course of a few years introduced
amost austere rule of life into the abbey of which he was the head. His
monks knelt on the iloor during their refections, and some of them were
in the habit of drinking out of skulls. They abstained from egga fish,
butter, oil, aud even salt, and confined themselves to pottage made of
herbs boiled in water, and breed so coarse and black that beasts refused to
eat of it. After a while they gave up wine also. Clement Vlll permitted
the society to draw up constitutions for the establishment ol their rule.
By these the excessive rigour of their way of life was checked, which was
done in obedience to the Pope, and in consequence of the deaths of
lourteen mouks in a single week at Feiiillans. These constitutions were
ratified iu 1595. Assumlng, of which there seems no doubt, that the
Folitani of Racon are the Febillans, l may remark that the Latinised form
of Teiiillans used is Fuliensis, as an adjective3 the proper style of the
society being “Congregatio Cistertiomonastica B. Mariae Fuliensis.” l
have not seen the work of Morotius to which Helyot, from whom the pre·
ceding account is taken, refers ; but in that of C. Hemique, also mentioned
by Helyot, l do not find any authority for Folitani. lt is probable that
Bacon's chief information on the subject was gathered orally during his
residence in France, before the Feiiillans had ceased from their first love.
The expression “ordo ι ι s fere evanuit ” must be taken to mean that the
severe rule that they had at first was given up. See Helyot, Hist. des
Ordres Monastiques, iv¹¹²⁰ partie, c. 38. [Tome v.] spondanus, An. 1586,
iv. F or some particulare of the early history of the Abbey of Feiiillans,
and especially for the will of Jean de la Barrlere‚ see Voyage Litteraire de
deux Benddictins, ii. p. 16.¹

The Histoire des Ordres Monastiques was published anonymously at
Paris, in 8 vols, the first appearing in 1714. ln the Voyage Litteraire, dcc.
