vulgo magis constare ex viscosa aliqua materia splendida et
accensa⁸⁹, quam esse naturae igneae fortioris. Sed de hoc
inquiratur ulterius.

aarum Sunt quaedam coruscationes⁹⁰ quae praebent lumen
sed non urunt; eae vero semper fiunt sine tonitru.

Ad ⁵·m ¹0¹· Eructationes et eruptiones flammarum inveniuntur
non minus in regionibus frigidis quam calidis3 ut in Islandia
et Groenlandia: quemadmodum et arbores per regiones frigi·
das magis sunt quandoque inflammabiles et magis piceae ac
resinosae quam per regiones calidas ; ut fit in abiete, pinu,
et reliquis: verum in quali situ et natura soli hujusmodi erup-
tiones fieri soleant, ut possimus affirmativae subjungere nega·
tivam, non satis quaesitum est91.

awos Omnis flamma perpetuo est calida magis aut
minus⁹², neque omnino subjungitur negativa: ettamen rese·
runt ignem fatuum⁰³ (quem vocant), qui etiam aliquando
impingitur in parietem, non multum habere caloris; sortasse
instar flammae spiritus vini, quae clemens et lenis est⁹⁴. Sed

⁸⁹ This opinion probably arose from their pent-like shape as they dart
across the bearem, and from the manner in which they appear to be
suddenly lindled and then again suddenly extinguished. ln reality‚ these
aerolites usually consist mainly of metallic iron, the rest ol their substance
being made up of a variety oi other metals.

⁹⁰ Sheet-lightning. This phenomenon occurs when the discharge oi
electricity takes place below the horizon, or behind a dense cloud, or
at great elevations above the earth’s sursace. On these occasions, the
distance is too great or the intervening obstacle too dense ior the thunder
to be heard.

⁹¹ We must recolleet that, at this time, not even the conception of a
sciense of geology had been formed. lt is needless to say that volcanoes,
hot springs (see below), and similar phenomena have no connection what·
ever with the temperature of the suriace of the soil.

⁹² The temperature oi a flame depends on the nature of the substance
burnt and on the nature of the medium in which the combustion takes
place. For the relation between the heat and luminosity of different
kinds of flame, see the article on Combustion in Watts’ Dictionary ot
Chemistry.

ω ‘Will o' the Wisp.’ This phenomenon probably arises from the escape
of marsh gas (light carburetted hydrogen) from the earth at night-time,
when a faint light is easily visible. How the gas becomes ignited, it is
sometimes difficult to say. A frequent cause of its ignition, probably, is
contact with phosphoretted hydrogen.
