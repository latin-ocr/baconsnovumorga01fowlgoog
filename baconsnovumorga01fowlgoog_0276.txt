Sed demonstratio longe optima est experientia⁷¹; modo
haereat in ipso experimento. Nam si traducatur ad alia quae
similia existimantur, nisi rite et ordine fiat illa traductio, res
fallax estii. At modus experiendi, quo homines nunc
utuntur, caecus est et stupidus⁷³. Itaque cum errant et

'⁰ Mr. Kitchin refers to i. roo-105. 1 think that the reference is
rather to the Second Book.

⁷¹ We may, perhaps, here detect the germ of the doctrine, after·
wards propounded with such emphasis by Loclre and his successore, that
all our knowledge may ultimately be traced to experience. That this
is the case even with Geometrical Axioms (one of the strongcst instances
in opposition to this doctrine adduced by the rival school of psychologists)
has been recently argued on novel grounds, and with a force amounting
almost to demonstration, by Prolessor Helmholtz‚ following Riemann, iu
an article in ‘Mind,' No. 3.

⁷² The detection ofa law of Causation can alone warrant us in founding
ageueral conclusion on our observations and experiments. On the dis-
tinction between Laws of Causation and Empirical Laws, which are
‘uniit to be relied on beyond the limits of time, place, aud circumstance,
in which the observations have been made,’ see Mill’s Logic, blr. iii. ch.
1⁶. Mr. Mill, however, uses the expression ‘Empirical Laws’ somewhat
loosely. lt would be better to confine it entirely to the results of Inductio
per Enumerationem Simplicem as distinguished from the results given by the
lnductive Methods, in which there is always sorne evidence of facts of
causation. See my Inductive Logic, ch. 4 (3rd Ed. pp. κιρ-παι).

There are many departments of knowledge and practice in which it is
almost impossible to exaggerate the importancc of insisting on a precise
repetition of all the circumstances (or, at least, all the material circum·
stances) of the case, before inferring that the same result will recur.
This is strikingly illustrated by the widely different effects of medicines in
different climates. See, for instances, the Introduction to Dr. Paris'
Pharmacologia, pp. rao-12 3.

²³ The faults in experimentation as then practised, which are noted by
Bacou in this Aphorism, may be enumerated as five:

(1) Undue extension of inferences based on experience to other instances
apparently similar, without sufficient cantion in allowing for possible dif-
serences of circumstances ;

(a) Eup-hazard experiment, without pursuing any definite order or
making any selection of instances.

( 3) lnsufficient variation of experiments;
