The whole passage from which this extract is taken is interesting, as
shewiog the immature character of Bacon’s astronomica] theories.

ln a note on this Aphorism, Mr. Ellis says: ‘lt does not appear in what
sense Bacon uses the word “draco” ln its ordinary acceptation in old
astronomy, it denoted the great circle which is approximately the projection
on the sphere of the moon’s orbit. The ascending node was called the
caput draconis, aad the descending the cauda draconis. The same terms
were occasionally applied to the nodes οἱ the planetary orblts. lt is not
improbable that Bacon intended to complain oi the rejection of spirals
ol double curvature, or helices, which, traced on the surlace of the sphere,
might represent inequalities in latitude. Compare (Nov. Org. ii. 48)
'what is said of the variations of which the “motus rotationis spontaneus”
admits?

Cp. a passage in the De Augmentis, lib. iii. cap. 4 (E. aad S, vol.
i. p. 552), where Bacon complainsr ‘At vix quisquam est, qul inquisivit
causas physicas turn de ..... tum de motuum obliquatione, vel per spiras
se versus tropicos texendo et retexendo, vel per sinuationes quas Dracones
vocant.¹

⁶¹ The four elements were imagined as having each its natural place,
earth being lowest and aether or lire highest. As the orb os lire is
above that of air, itis too remote from us to be an object of sense.

⁸² This doctrine which prevailed throughout the Schools, though entirely
unsupported by evidence and even in spite ol the evidence ol the senses,
owes its origin toa mistaken interpretation os a passage in Aristotle,
De Generatione et corruptione, ii. 6 (p. 333 a. 16-34). The student, on
referring to the passage, will find that the ‘decupla ratio’ is only put
hypothetically, lor the sake of example: ‘olor ci ἐξ ὕδατος κοτύλης εἶεν
c'c'pos dian3’ ὀἷον ri κοτύλη cidaras ἴσον δύναται ψύχειν καὶ δέκα lipari
The order of the elements would, of course, be earth, water, air, lire. Α
liith clement was added by Aristotle and the Peripatetics‚ which was
regarded as peculiar to the celestial regions aad as being the material
oi which the heavenly bodies were composed. lt was called aether. See,
