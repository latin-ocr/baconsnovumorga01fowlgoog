²⁷ So called from the ‘Tribus Praerogativa' which, being selected by
lot, voted first in the ‘Comitia Tributa' of the Romans, and thus afforded
an indication ot the mode in which the other tribes were likely to vote.
lts vote also frequently exercised a considerable intluence on the succeed-

. ing votes.

‘By the prerogatives oi instances,' says Sir John Herschel (Discourse on
the Study of Natural Philosophy, § 190), ‘Bacon understands characteristic
phenomena, selected from the great miscellaneous mass of facts which
occur in nature, and which, by their number, indistinctness, and com·
plication, tend rather to confuse than to direct the mind in its search
for causes and general beads oi induction. Phenomena so selected on
account ot some peculiarly forcible way in which they strike the reason,
and impressus with a kind of sense of causation, or a particular aptitude
tor generalisation, he considers, and justly, as holding a kind of prerogative
dignity, and claiming our first and especial attention in physical enquiriest

On the more important oi these ‘praerogativae instantiarum' some ex·
cellent remarks and illustrations will be found in Herschel's Discourse,
δια, §t 190-200, Playsair's Preliminary Dissertation to the Encyclopaedia
Britannica, Section a, and Dr. Hippus’ Account of the Novum Organum,
Part ii, in the Library of Useful Knowledge (which, however, borrows
largely from Playtair's Dissertation). From these sources, 1 shall, aswe
proceed, extract what appears to me most valuable.

ln the ‘General Prelace to the Philosophical Works‚' hlr. Ellis remarks
that ‘to the word instance Bacon gives a wide range ol signification. lt
corresponds more nearly to ohservation than to any other term which is
used in modern scientitic language.’

²⁸ Cp. the passage at the end oi the book: ‘Nunc vero ad adminicula et
rectficationes inductionis, et deinceps ad concreta, et latentes processus, et
latentes schematismos, et reliqua, quae aphorismo 21. ordine proposuimus,
pergendum! ln this passage ‘ad concreta’ seems to answer to the
‘Variatio Inquisitionis pro Natura Subjecti' of the text, and, perhaps.
‘Latentes Processus et Latentes Schematismi’ to the ‘Deductio ad
Praxin,' though M. Bouillet refers these also to the Variatio inquisitionis.

Mr. Ellis (General Preface, p. 43) observes that the practical utility
of the prerogative instances would have been explained when Bacon came
to speak ot the Adminicula inductionis. hl. Bouillet, on the other hand,
thinks that the ‘Adminicula inductionis’ were to embrace the ‘Minis-
tratio ad Sensum' and ‘Ministratio ad Memoriam,' mentioned in rlph.
10. He refers to the conclusion ot Aphs. 42 and 43, and quotes from the
Partis Secundae Delineatio the words ‘ministratio ad rationem cui minis·
trationes duae priores subministrant! See E. and 8., νοΙ. iii. p. 553.

ln M. Bouillet’s note on this Aphorism, there is an attempt to determine
the exact character of these missing parts of the Novum organum,
and, where possible, to supply them from other portioris of Bacon's works.
