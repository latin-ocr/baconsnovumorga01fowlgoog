The best German translation, 1 believe, is Franz Baco's Neues
Organon, Uebersetzt, erlatitert, &c., von J. H. von Kirchmann. Berlin,
1870 (published in Kirchmann's Philosophische Bibliotbel). Previous
German translations are those of Bartholdy (rst Book only), 1793;
and of Brilclr, 1830.

l have seen an Italian translation (anonymous) published at Bassano
in1788: Nuovo Organo delle Scienze di Francesco Bacone, tec.
Traduzione in Italiano, con Annotazioni, &c Whether there is any
more recent translation, 1 am not avare.

In the Leipsic edition of the Novum Organum, 1839, a Portuguese
translation os the Obras philosophicas, by Jac. de Castro sarmento, is
mentioned as having been published in London, with notes, in 3 vols.
eto, in1731.

ht Cracovr in1834, there was published a book entitled Bakona
Metoda Tlumacaenia Natnry (the Baconian Method ol interpreting
Nature), by Michal Wiszniewski.

There is a Sanslrrit version oi the Novum Organnm, published by
order of the Government of the N. W. provinces, lor the use of the

Benares Sanskrit College, and prepared by Pandit Vitthala S’Astrl, -

Benares, 1852. The materiale for this version were published ina

separate form by J. A. Ballantyne at Mirzapore in 1852. ‘Each

The pieceis entitled Methone et conceptione dn sieur Verulana, Chan·²
d'Angleterre, and begins ‘Tablaan des belles et rares conceptione de Messire
hangois Vernlam Chan⁶² de la grand Bretagne touchants le restablissemen des

throughout, including the Deest Para Prima, irc, which, so istrael am aware,
occurs in no other edition oi the serenteenth or eighteenth centana. The trans·

The and Book is translated as iar as the words ¹ de forma aalidi’ in Aplr. 11. just
before the commenoement nl the Tables. There are no blank leaves aiter this.

This translation is not, so lar as 1 can ascertaiu, mentioned by any writer on
Baoon. and the translations ol lasalle and Iorqnet bear no signs oi its having been
amulred by those authors.

lam inclined to suspect that this translation may have been made by J. Bandoin,
who published banalations oi so many other works oi Βαωη, and who, as appears
{rom the ‘Privileige da Roy,’ prefixed to his Aphorismea du Droit. had by him a
