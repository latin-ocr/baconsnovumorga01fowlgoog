It would be superfluous to extend this enquiry beyond the point at
which we have now arrived, as, at the end of the seventeenth century,
we are already iu the full tide of experimental research, when the fame
and influence of Bacon were, as 1 believe, universally acknowledged ³⁰.
But, before I proceed to consider the nature of this influence, it is
necessary that I should entertain a question which hasbeen the occa·
sion of considerable dispute, namely, the cause of the complete, and, as
it has seemed to some, singular silence as to Bacou which is maintained
by his illustriores successor, Newton. Some refer it to contemptuous
indifference. Thus, Sir David Brewster, whose judgment Remusat
accepts, roundly asserts that ‘Newton would have enriched scienee
with the same splendid discoveries, if the name aud the writings of
Baeon had never been heard of,' aud says oddly enough, as Ι have
already pointed out, that ‘Boyle treated him with the same disrespect·
ful silence ³¹! On the other hand, Horace Walpole³¹ calls Bacon
‘the Prophet of Arts, which Newton was sent afterwards to reveal,’
aud Reid ³³ speaks of Newton, as ‘having in the third book of his
Principia and in his Optics, had the rules of the Novum Organum
constantly iu his eye! Between these conflictiug views 1 shall
attempt to decide, considering, first, the extemal evidence of Bacon's
influence on Newton, secondly, the internal evidence, so far as it can
be derived from Newton's own writings, and, lastly, the interpretation
to be put upon his silence with respect to Bacon’s name and works.

Pemberton, in his View of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy (1728),
informs us distinctly that Newton ‘approved of the following treatise‚
a great part of which we read together’ (Preface). Now, in the
introduction to this work, the author almost at once begins to speak
of the irrational method formerly pursued in scientific enquiries, by
‘framing conjectures,' ‘undertaking intire systems,' ‘fathoming at
once the greatest depths of nature,’ &o ‘Whereas the only method‚
that can alfordus any prospect of success in this difficult work, is to
make our enquiries with the utmost caution, and by very slow
degrees! ‘This neglect,' he proceeds, ‘of the proper means to
enlarge our knowledge, joined with the presumption to attempt what

influeret of Baeon were uow so much taken for granted, that, naturally enough, less
tras probably said about thern than iu the previous generation.
