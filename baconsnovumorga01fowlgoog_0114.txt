likely to have seen the Opus Majus. Nor,I may add, is be likely to have
been acquainted with any of the works in which remarks such as those
above quoted are to be found ⁴. The parallelisms, therefore, between
the two writers, however close in some casea, are, 1 believe, accidental.

Having thus dwelt with some minuteness on the anticipations of
Bacon's teaching to be found in the works of his almost equally
illustrious namesake in the thirteenth century, I may pass more
lightly over the intermediate period.

Passing over about two centuries, during which, it may be noticed‚
the precepta and example of Roger Bacon seem to have had little
effect (for the schools were engaged with far different work), we come
to that almost universal genius-palmer, poet, sculptor, architect,
mechanist‚ mathematician, Leonardo da Vinci (b. 1452, d. 1519) ⁵.
Speaking of certain unpublished manuscripts by him, now in the
Library of the Institute at Paria, Libri (Histoire des Sciences Mathe·

⁴ Once. and 1 believe once only, Bacon refers to his namesake, and then in terms
of faint praise. See Temporis Partus Masculus (E. and S.. vol. iii. p. 534) : ‘Si-
quidem utile genus comm est, qui de theoriis non admodum solliciti, mechanica
quadam subtilitate rerum inventarum extensiones prehendunt; qualis est Bacon.'
In the Historia Vitae et Mortis, however, there are traces ol bis having read
Dr. Dee's translation (published in 1618) of Roger Bacon’s tract De potestate
mirabili Artis et Naturae. He may also have read the treatise De retardaudis
senectutis accidentibus, which was published in Latin at Oxford in ¹590·

⁸ Hallam, Libri, Wbewell, Brewster, and Remusat, all refer to J. B. Venturi,
Fssaf sur les Ouvrages PhysicoMathematiques de Leonard de Vinci, Paris, 1799.
Α copy of this tract, which is, l believe, very rare, exista in the British Museunr,
but 1 do not know whether the MSS. referred to in it bave ever been published in
full. Wbewell quotes from Venturi the following striking maxims:

⁸⁰·The0ry is the general, Experiments are the soldiers. The interpreter of the
artifices of nature is Experiencea she is never deceived. Ourjudgment sometimes
is deceived, because it expects effecta which Experience refuses to allow.” And again,
“We must consult Expericnce, and vary the circumstances till we have drawn from
them general rules; for it is she who fumishes true rules. Birt of what use, you
ask, are these rufus: 1 reply, that they direct us in the researches of nature and the
operations of art. They prevent our imposing upon ourselves and others by pro·
mising ourselves results which we cannot obtain.

‘⁸‘ In the study of the sciences which depeud on Mathematics. those who do not
consult nature but authors. are not the children of nature, they are only her grand·
children. She is the true teacher of men of genius. But see the absurdity of menl
They tum up their noses at a man who prefers to leam from nature herself rather
than from authors who are only her clerks.”

⁸ ln another place, in reference to a particular case, be says, “Nature begins from
the Reason and ends in Experience; but for all that, we must take the opposite
course; begin from the Experiment aad try to discover the Reason.''’ Wbewell's
Philosophy of Discovery, pp. 106, 107.

ι ln Haliam's History of Literature, Part i. ch. 3. sect. 5. to which the student
would do well to refer, there is a still fuller account of Venturi's tract.
