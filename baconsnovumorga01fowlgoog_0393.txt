nare-naa. Existimamus huic instantiae non subjungi nega-
tivam. Nullum enim invenitur apud nos corpus tangibile,
quod non ex attritione manifesto calescat ¹³3 adeo ut veteres
somniarent non inesse coelestibus aliam viam aut virtutem
calefaciendi nisi ex attritione aeris per rotationem rapidam
et incitatam ¹⁴. Verum in hoc genere ulterius inquirendum
est, utrum corpora quae emittuntur ex machmis (qualia sunt
pilae ex tormentis) non ex ipsa percussione contrahant ali-
quem gradum caloris3 adeo ut postquam deciderint invenian-
tur nonnihil calida ¹⁵. At ae'r motus magis infrigidat quam

¹³ This is perfectly true. Motion or mechanical force and beat are
mutually convertible. Motion may always be converted into beat, and
heat into motion. This is the fundamental axiom of the modern science
of Heat.

¹⁴ Mr. Ellis refers to Arist. Meteorol. bk. i. ch. a (ch. 3 of Berlin Edi·
tion, p. 341 a) sub finem, and De Coelo, ii. 7 (p. 288 a). The latter pas·
sage is peculiarly interesting: ἡ δέ θερμότης ἀπ’ αὐτῶν (sc. τῶν ἄστρων) καὶ τὸ
φῶο γίνεται πορεκτριβομένον τοῦ ἀέρος ὑπὸ τῆς ἐκείνων φορᾶς. πέφυκε γὰρ r'y
κίνησις ἐκπυροῦν καὶ ξύλα καὶ λίθους καὶ σίδηρον· εὐλογώτερον οὖν τὸ ἐγγύτερον
τοῦ πυρός, ἐγγύτερον δὲ ὁ ἀήρ, οἶον καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν φερομένων βελῶν· ταῦτα γὰρ
αὐτὰ ἐκπυροῦται οὕτως, κ. τ, λ. Mr. Ellis remarks that ‘it seems probable
that Aristotle was influenced by a wishto secure the doctrine of the
etemity of the universe. which he saw would be put in peril if celestial heat
was ascribed to anything alin to combustion.'

That Aristotle’s theory was not inherently impossible will be plain from
the following passage, taken from Tyndall’s Heat a Mode of Motion, § 12:
·‘ The most probable theory of shooting stars is that they are small plane·
tary bodies revolvlng round the sun, which are caused to swerve from their
orbits by the attraction of the· earth, and are raised to incandescence by
friction against our atmosphere. Chladni propounded this view, and
Dr. Joule has shewn that the atmospheric friction is competent to pro·
duce the effect! Professor Tyndall, at the beginning of thls section,
refers to Aristotle’s statement thatarrows are heated by passing through
the air.

¹⁶ This ls so. A bullet or a cannen-hall is heated by passing through
the air. Cp. what Aristotle says in the passage quoted 'above about the
heatIng of arrows.

¹⁶ The cooling effect in these cases is due to the lact that fresh draughts
of air are constantly brought into contuct with the body, the loss ol heat
from the latter being thus rendered more rapid than it would be if the
