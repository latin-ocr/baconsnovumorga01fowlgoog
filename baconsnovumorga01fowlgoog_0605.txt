superfluous to give any instances. See, lor example, Paracelsus, passim,
and especially the treatises De Origine Morborum and De Morbis Tar·
tareis, as well aethe worhs referred to at the end ol the last note but
one. The ‘Doctrina of Signatures' was one of the most absurd forms under
which this conceit appeared. See Paracelsus, De signatura Remm [Op
Omn, vol. ii. pp. roo-1⁶), and, sora good modern account ol the theory,
Dr. Paris’ Pharmacologia, p. 47, &o From the latter work, 1 have ex·
tracted several sentences on this subject in the last chapter of my ludur-
tive Logic (see 3rd En, pp. 347-9). Dr. Paris detines the doctn‘ne asa
‘belief that every natural substance, which possesses arsy medecina! vinus,
indicates, hy an obvious aad well-marked exter-nal character, the dr'seasesrr
which lt is a remedy, or· the object sor which it should he mployedss lle

clothes, oron his cut hair or nails, dcc.

Of a similar character was the belief that particular cures could onlyhe
performed hy particular people, as in the case of the King's Evil.

Pliny, Nat. Hist. xviii. 3² (75), 28 (68), and other passages; Aulus Gellius,
xx. 8. Some ol the directions given by Pliny are of a very odd character.
Thus, ‘stercus nisi decrescente luna ne tangito e ι ο ova luna nora

Cp. Tylor’s Primitive Culture, vol. i. p. 130 (and Ed). He quotes
Tusscr's Five Hundred Points os Husbandry:

‘Sowe peason and beans in the wane of the moone,
Who soweth thern sooner, he soweth too soone:
That they, with the planet, may rest and rise,
And flourish with bearing, most plentilul wisc!

Cardan (De Rerum Varietate, lih. ii. cap. 13) has some curious remarks un
the same subject.

¹⁹ He here alludes to the supposed correspondence between the appear·
ances of the moon and the weather. See Virgrl, Georgics, i. sas-37, and

the corresponding passage in Aratus, Διοσῃμιῖα, p. 46, διας Pliny, Nat.
