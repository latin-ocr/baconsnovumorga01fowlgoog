INTRODUCTION. 127

‘crucial instance,' ‘clandestine instance,’ ‘solitary instance,' and the
like, have become household words in our language, and especially iu
the vocabulary of scientific men.

yth, The manner in which he insisted on the subordination of
scientific enquiries to practical airus, the furtherance of man’s estate
and the increase of his command over the comforts and conveniences
ol life, is another point in which, 1 think, Bacon profoundly influenced
succeeding generations. That his view was too exclusive, and his
language exaggerated, 1 readily own, but here again, as in criticising
the abuse of authority aud imagination, 1 think it difficult to deny that
his induence was, on the whole, most beneficial. When we recollect
the frivolous character of 'many of the questions which men oi the
most brilliant abilities were then in the habitos disputing, and the
profound misery or discomlort in which the mass of mankind, then
even more than now, were sunk, we can hardly feel surprise or regret
that a great statesman and a great philosopher should have suggested
the application of man's intellectual cndowments to the improvement
ol his material condition.

8th, Nor must we forget the hopefulncss of Bacon asan important
clement in his influence. Men who despair of mankind and of the
future are, happily, seldom successlul in persuading others to accept
their advice or their systems. There is a healthy instinct in man
which leads him to believe that the future will be better than the past,
and that the labours of the present generation will not be without
their effect in improving the condition of the next. No man was
ever inspired with this feeling more strongly than Bacon. He stood,
like a prophet, on the verge of the promised land, hidding men leave,
without regret, the desert that was behind them, and enter with
joyfulness and hopelulness ou the rich inheritance that was spread
before them. The sixth part of the Great Instauration, to which all
the rest was subservient, the philosophy itself which was to be the
result of the right employment of the method, he hoped only to
begin. ‘The fortune of the human race,' he says, ‘will give the
issue 3-such an issue, it may be, as in the present condition of things
and of the minds of men cannot easily be conceived or imagined.
For the object in view is not only the contemplative happiness, but
the whole fortunas, and affairs, and powers, and works of men ⁴⁰!

9th, To all these sources of influence we must add the marvellous

language in which Bacon ollen clothes his thoughts. His utterances
