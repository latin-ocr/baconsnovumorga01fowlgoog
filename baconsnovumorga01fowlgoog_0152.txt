independent investigation, as the First Book os the Novum Organum.
What Bacon says ol Plato is pre-eminently true ol himself. He was
'aman ola sublime genius, who took a view ol everything as from
a high rock⁴¹.' Now to the young student I know nothing os so
much importance asto be brought into contact witb works ol real
genius, 3ηά there must be many men who recollect the transition
from dry manuals ol Logic to the brilliant pages os Bacon as forming
one os the eras in their lives. Maaims such as these, ‘Homo naturae
minister et interpres,’ ‘Scientia et potentia humana in idem coinci-
dunt,' ‘Lucifera experimenta, non fructifera, quaerenda,' ‘Recte veritas
temporis filia dicitur, non auctoritatis,’ ‘Pessima res est errorum
apotheosis,’ which sparkle on almost every page, live long in the
memory, and insensibly influence our whole habit of thought This
educational value of the Novum Organum has never,I think, been
sufficiently pointed out, but it seems to me very real and very
important. As 1 have already noticed under the last section, there is
something about Bacon's diction, his quaintness ol expression, and
his power of illustration, which lays hold ol the mind, and lodges
itsell in the memory, in a way which we hardly find paralleled in any
other author, except it be Shakspeare. And what are the lessons
which he thus effectually communicatas? The duty ol taking nothing
upon trust which we can verily sor ourselves, ol rigidly examining
our first principles, os being carelully on our guard against the various
delusions arising lrom tbe peculiarities os burnan nature, from our
various interests and pursuits, from the force ol words, and lrom
the disputes 3ηά traditions ol the schools, the duty of forming our
conclusions slowly and ol constantly checking them by comparison
with the facts ol nature and lile, of avoiding merely subtle and
frivolous disputations, os confining our enquiries to questions of which
the solution is within our power, and ol subordinating all our in-
vestigations to the welt'are os man and society. Now, lessons such
as these, even though they be stated in a somewbat exaggerated
form, are so necessary and so useful, that an author who presents
them in lorcible and pointed language will ever retain bis interest
and utility for each succeeding generation ol leamers. ·

As regards the second ol these questions, the amount ol definite
logical teaching in Bacon's works which retains a permanent value,
the answer is less easy. I cannot, however, agree with those critics
who seem to think that almost all his individual precepts are either
