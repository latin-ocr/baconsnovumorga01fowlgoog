aoth Aphorlsm, as illustrating the theory which he has himself so ably
and clearly expounded.

On an impartial investigation, then, ol this question ¹⁵,1 think we
must conclude that, while Bacon undoubtedly did not possess any
extensive or precise acquaintance with any single branch os science,
and while, in some respecta, his writings did not keep pace with the
discoveries oi the day, his range ol vision covered an extraordinarily
vast sweep os knowledge, and his scientific conceptions, and the
suggestions which from time to time he throws out, occasionally shew
a marvellous amount ot' sagacity and penetration. That they were
also fertile in the subsequent History ol Science, by raising man’s
hopes ol what might be achieved‚ by stimulating to enquiry, and by
actually supplying new points of view in the interpretation ol nature,
I can hardly entertain any doubt.

Two ol the most striking Aphorisms in the First Book of the
Novum Organum are the 65th and 89th. In the lormer, aster
speaking oi the ‘corruptio philosophiae ex superstitione et theologia
admista,' Bacon goes on to say: ‘Pessima enim res est errorum
apotheosis, et pro peste intellectus habenda est, si vanis accedat
veneratio. Huic autem vanitati nonnulli ex modernis summa levitate
ita indulserunt, ut in primo capitulo Geneseos, et in libro Job, et aliis

otherwise than as a complete turture! But, though I cannot admit this criticism
as other than very exaggerated even as to the mode ot' enquiry, with regard to the
result it is surely a sufficient answer that Bacon did, as a matter ol laet, divine the
true nature ol heat.

¹⁵ It must be understood that 1 have not attempted to give an exhaustive account
either of Bacon's scientific errors or ol his scientitic claims to recognition. In each
case, I have only attempted to select typical examples, though 1 think 1 have in·
cluded nearly all the points ol real importance on either side.

Os the invention ol the thermomcter, ascribed to Bacon by De Vanzelles and
Bouillet, I have said nothing, because l think the lact that Bacon, in none ol the
places where he makes mention oi this instrument, advances any claim to its inven-
tion, is alone a sufficient reason, il not sor positively denying his invention ol it,
at least tor not positively ascribing it to him. Mr. Ellis tin a note on Nov. Org.
it 13 (38) and Re'musat (pp. 34, 35) agree in thinking that the invention has been
ascribed to Bacon without good reason. It is probably due, in the first instance,
to Galileo.
