Democritus and Epicurus. For it is a thousand times more credible,
that four mutable elements, and one immutable fifth essence, duly
and etemally placed, need no God, than that an army of infinite
small portions or seeds unplaced‚ should have produced this order
and beauty without a divine marshal!

and. I cannot question that Bacon also accepted the doctrine of a
Divine Providence and a providential order 01 the world. This, in
fact, is implied in the above passage. But the student will do well to
read the more explicit statement on this subject, contained in De
Augmentis, ii. 11¹⁹. This passage, which, in substance, occurs also
in the Advancement of Learning, must have passed under Bacon’s
hands and received his final approval as late as 1622 or 1623.

3111. 11 we compare De Angmentis, lib. i. (E. and S, vol. i. pp. 483,
484), lib. iv. cap. 1. (p. 585), and lib. iv. cap. 3 (pp. 605, 606), 110
shall, Ι thinlr, conclude that, while Bacon had 00 doubt as to the
immortality of the soul, he was, like some of the early fathers,
inclined 10 regard the belief as resting rather on a direct revelation
from God than on a necessary, or perhaps even legitimare, conclusion
01 human reason ²⁰.

4th. With respect to the Christian mysteries‚ Bacon seems, at least
in his earlier years, to have been inclined to trust himself to the
guidance of the church; meaning, doubtless, the church as under-
stood by James and Andrewes, which, passing over the intennediate
times 01 Roman superstition, boasted 01 its now restored connection
with the age of the primitive fathers. ‘At restat adhuc,' he sayS, at
the beginning 01 the last Book 01 1110 De Augmentis, ‘Theologia
Sacra, sive Inspirata Veruntamen si eam tractare 1101ςο10110,οκ-
eundum nobis foret e Navicula Rationis Humanae, et transeundum
in Ecclesiae Navem ; qnae sola Acu Nautica Divina pollet 011 cursum
recte dirigendum’ How far Bacon’s confidence in the ‘ship of the
church' was implicit, and without exception, is, 1 thinlr, somewhat
doubtful. For it is 0 notable fact (which I have not seen elsewhere
noticed) that the passage on the nature and attributes 01 God,

¹⁰ Cp. also the passage on the proper sphere of Natural Theology in De Aug·
mentis, iii. a: ¹ Quocirca, quod sit Deus. quod rernm habenas tractet, quod summe
potens, quod sapiens et praescius, quod bonus, quod remunerator, quod vindex, quod
adorandus, etiam ex operibus ejus demonstrari et evinci potest!

²⁰ It is notahle that in the chapter on Natural Tbeology, quoted in the last note.
he does not mention the doctrine of the Immortality of the Soul‚ though he certainly
says nothing to intimate any desire of positively excluding it from the sphere of
these enquiries.
