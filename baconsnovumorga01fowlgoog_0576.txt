omnia majorem in modum condensata motum exhorrent,

modis vellicentur et provocentur ad motum, tamen naturam
suam (quoad possunt) tuentur. Quod si ad motum com·
pellantur, tamen hoc agere semper videntur ut quietem et
statum suum recuperent, neque amplius moveant. Atque
circa hoc certe se agilia praebent, et satis perniciter et
rapide (ut pertaesa et impatientia omnis morae) contendunt.
Hujus autem appetitus imago ex parte tanturn cerni potest;

On Bacon's vague and improper use of the word ‘ motion,’ see the first
note on this Aphorism. Here it cannot be rendered even by ‘process’ or
‘operation,' but we must resort to some word os very wide meaning, such
as ‘tendency’ or ‘affection' os matter.

‘laertia’ the property os which Bacon here speaks, is simply the inca·
pacity of matter to change its own state of rest or motion. The obscure
notions of Bacon aud his contemporaries about motion presented them
from seeing that this property applies as much to the tendency oi a body
in motion to go on moving as to that oia body at rest to remain at rest.
Fora brief account os the establishment of the First Law of motion (which
seems to have been first enunciated by Galileo in 1⁶38), see Whewell’s
History of the lnductive Sciences, vol. ii. bh. vi. ch. a.

⁸⁷ Bacon seems never weary of parading his belief in the immobility of
the earth.

⁶³ Cp. what he says above under ‘Motus Duodecimust’ ‘ita ut veri-
simile sit posse esse,’ &c lt was one of the leading doctrines os Telesius
that the sun, and the heaveuly bodies generally, modify the suriace of the
earth and the parts adjacent to the suriaco, rendering them rarer and
warmer than they are by their own nature; while the interior parts of
the earth exhibit its peculiar characteristics of coldness, crassness, dark-
ness, and immobility. See Telesius, De Rerum Natura, lib. i. (especially
chs.5,10-14); Bacon, De Principiis atque Originibus, E. aud S., vol. iii.
tu>- 98-9·

Towards the end ol Aph. ro, Bacou uses the expression ‘imbutum a
coelestibus,’ on which see note.
