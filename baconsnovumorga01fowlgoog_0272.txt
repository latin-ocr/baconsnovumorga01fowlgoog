⁸⁸ Bacon here undoubtedly exaggeratas Aristotle's tendency to dog·
matism. The student of Aristotle will recall several passages where, after
stating different solutions of a question, the author leaves his own opinion
doubtful. This occasional uncertainty as to the precise character of his
own conclusions is, in fact, one of the main sources of difficulty to those
who are beginning the study of Aristotle's works.

⁸⁰ On the doctrines of the New Academy, see note 41 on Aph· 37·
The process by which the dogmatism of the early Platonists passed into
the scepticism of the New Academy would form an interesting enquiry
in the history of philosophy. In the first place, it may be observed that
there was from the beginning awell·marked negative vein in the philosophy
oi Socrates and Plato. This, which was connected with their dialectica}
method and the determination to examine all sides of a question, even
ii the examination led to no further result, is well brought out by Mt.
Grote both in the chapter on Socrates in his History of Greece and in the
oth chapter of his work on Plato. When men found that a question might
be discnssed with so much ability'on all sides, and that often without attain-
ing any positive result, it was not unnatural to conclude that there was
no result to be attained. Then, the εἰρωνεία, or affectation of ignorance,
which was so marked a feature in the conversation of Socrates, and which
is so carefully and frequently depicted in the dialogues of Plato, must have
had a similar effect in leading men to despair of the possibility of know·
ledge. To this characteristic Bacon here alludes in the words, ‘primo
tanquam per jocum et ironiam,’ dic. The objectos Socrates, however,
was not to induce scepticism, but to purify the mind from all pre-conceived
opinions, in order to prepare it for the more impartial investigation of
truth. Lastly, Plato had spared no pains in demolishing the general belief
in the trustworthiness and accuracy of sense-knowledge, in order to rear
on its ruins his theory of ideas. This doctrine, in its turn, had been
severely criticised, and, in the opinion of many, refuted by Aristotle.
Hence, we cannot be surprised if to some there seemed to be no way out
of the dialectical puzzles and subtleties by which the question of the
reality of knowledge was perplexed. The solution of these difficulties
offered by the philosophers of the New Academy, in their ascending grades
of probability, hasbeen already given in note 41 on Aph. 37.

ln the De Augmentis, lib. i. (E. and S., vol. i. p. 462), Bacon couples the
name of Socrates with that of the [New] Academy: ‘Non negaverim in
summariis libellis ad praxim destinatis hanc formulam scribendi retineri
posse, verum in justis tractatibus de scientiis utrumque extremum vitandum
censeo, tam Velleii Epicurei, nil tam metuentis quam ne dubitare dere
aliqua videretur, quam Socratis et Academiae omnia in dubio relinquen·
tium’ The allusion to Velleius, the Epicurean, is horrowed from Cicero,
