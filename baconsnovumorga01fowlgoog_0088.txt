enquiry must remain consecrated to the service of God. As soon as
it intrudes into the province of Physics, it is attended with no results;
nay rather, as it diverts the mind frorn the enquiry into the efficient
and material causes, the proper objects of physics, it becomes
positively baneful ω.

Apparently inconsistent, however, with this limitation of the censure
on the pursuit of Final Causas are passages such as that in Nov.
Org. i. 48, where he seems to condemn thern generally, as being
‘plane ex natum hominis potius quam universi ⁶²!

Now, with regard to these passages, l may observe, first, that as
the De Augmentis received Bacon's final supervision after the pub·
-lication of the Novum Organum, and as far the most explicit and
elaborate passage on this subject is to be found in that work, we are
bound, if there is any contradiction, to accept Bacon's later and more
detailed rather than his earlier and more casual utterances ⁶².

In the second place, even though we may regard the analogy of
human actions (which are always directed to some specific end, and
that too oue which usually admits of being ascertained without
much difficulty) as wrongly applied to the processes of nature, it does
not follow that there is no plan whatsoever in the operations of
nature, or even that such plan may not, at least in its broad outlineS,
admit of being discovered by us. Of the ‘work which God worketh
from the beginning to the eud,’ namely the ‘summary law of nature,'
Bacon does indeed declare that ‘it may fairly be doubted whether'
man's inquiry can attain to it ⁶³‚' but, at the same time, we may attain
to a sufficientiy clear vision ol that work to perccive, at least, the
power, the wisdom, and the goodness of the source from which it
proceeds, foolish and inadequate as may be our goesses with regard
to the details of the scheme. And this, 1 think, is the answer which
Bacon himself would have made to any one who had charged him
with inconsistency in his different utterances on this, one of the most.

¹⁰ ‘At ex his, Causa F inalis tantum abest ut prosit, ut etiam scientias corrumpat,
nisi in hominis actionibus! Nov. Org. ii. a. See also the passage quoted above
from De Augm. iii. 4.

¹¹ To this it might, perhaps. be objected that the passage in the De Augrnentis is
little more than a repetition ofwhat appeared in Bacon's earlier work, the Advance·
ment oi Learning, which was first published in 1605. But we know alike from the
testimony of stley aud from hilernal evidence that Bacon thoroughly revised the
work, as it was undergoing translation, and, moreover, in this very passage there
are several alterations, including the important addition at the cad.
