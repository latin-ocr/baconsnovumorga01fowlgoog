At hisce omissis; si quis (exempli gratia) observaverit,
inesse corporibus appetitum contactus ⁵² ad invicem, utnon
patiantur unitatem naturae prorsus dirimi aut abscindi, ut
vacuum detur: aut si quis dicat, inesse corporibus appetitum
se recipiendi in naturalem suam dimensionem vel tensuram ⁶³,
ut, si ultra eam aut citra eam comprimantur aut distrahantur,
statim in veterem sphaeram et exporrectionem suam se
recuperare et remittere moliantur: aut si quisdicat, inesse
corporibus appetitum congregationis ad massas connaturalium
suorum, densorum videlicet versus orbem terrae, tenuiorum et
rariorum versus ambitum coeli⁶⁴: haec et hujusmodi vere
physica sunt generamotuum. At illa altera plane logica
sum et scholastica, ut ex hac collatione eorum manifesto
liquet.

Neque minus etiam malum est, quod in philosophiis et
contemplationibus suis, in principiis rerum atque ultimatibus
naturae investigandis et tractandis, opera insumatur; cum
omnis utilitas et facultas operandi in mediis consistat ⁶⁵.

⁸¹ This, as Mr. Kitchin says, embodies ‘a dim notion of attraction, based
on the old opinion asto Nature's abborrence ofa Vacuum! lt is, perhaps,
needless to add that the fact of attraction of adhesion (for it is to this that
Bacon appears to allude) has been established by subsequent researches,
whereas the theory that ‘Nature abhors a vacuum’ has long ago been
exploded. On the latter theory and the experiments which led to its final
abandonment, see Herschel’s Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy,
il aii-24⁶·

⁵³ This is obviously a description of the phenomenon of Elasticity.

Μ Cp. ii. 48 (7). Bacon is peculiarly unfortunate in his illustration of the
notiori of Affinity. The aggregation of bodies or rather particles which are
chemically homogeneous into large masses is an undoubted fact, but the
affinity of heavy things for the earth and of light things for the sky is a
mere fancy, implying the now exploded theory of absolute levity. Heavy
and light are, of course, only relative terms, and are better expressed
by more or less heavy; all bodies possessing weight, however various it
may be in amount. On the supposed substance Phlogiston, which was
regarded as essentially light, and the reasoning by which its existence
has been disproved, see Herschel's Discourse on the Study of Natural
Philosophy,§ 3 3⁶· The notion of absolute levity is connected with that
of natural motion, discussed under note 51 on this Aphorism.

⁵⁶ The fifth and last error under this head consists in the neglect of
intermediate axioms, and the excessive attention paid to the principles
of things and the ultimate constitution of nature. Cp. Aph. 104, where
this idea is still further expanded. lt is undoubtedly true that the practical
