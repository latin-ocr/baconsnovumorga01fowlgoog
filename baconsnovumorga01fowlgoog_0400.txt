LIB. ΙΙ. 13· 377

5. Non invenitur in partibus animalium, postquam fuerint
mortuae aut separatae, aliquid calidum ad tactum humanum.
Nam neque fimus equinus ipse, nisi fuerit conclusus et sepul-
tus, calorem retinet. Sed tamen omnis fimus habere'videtur
'calorem potentialem, ut in agrorum impinguatione. Et simi·
liter, cadavera animalium hujusmodi habent latentem et po·
tentialem calorem; adeo ut in coemeteriis ubi quotidie fiunt
sepulturae, terra calorem quendam occultum colligat, qui
cadaver aliquod recenter impositum consumit longe citius
quam terra pura ³⁵. Atque apud orientales traditur inveniri '
textile quoddam tenue et molle, factum ex avium plumagine,
quod vi innata butyrum solvat et liquefaciat in ipso leviter
involutum.

6. Quae impinguant agros ut fimi omnis generis, creta,
arena maris, sal, et similia, dispositionem nonnullam habent
ad calidum.

7. Omnis putrefactio in se rudimenta quaedam exilis caloris
habet³⁰, licet non hucusque ut ad tactum percipiatur. Nam
nec ea ipsa quae putrefacta solvuntur in animalcula ³⁷, ut carn,

caseus, ad tactum percipiuntur calida; neque lignum putre,

are a number of chemical agents, which, from their corroding, blacken-
ing, and dissolving, or drying up the parts of some descriptions of bodies,
and producing on them effects not generally uulike (though intrinsically
very different from) those produced by heat, are said, in loose and vulgar
language, to burn them; and this error has even become rooted into
aprejudice, by the fact that some of these agents are capable of becoming
actually and truly hot during their action on moist substances, by reason of
their combination with the water the latter contain. Thus, quiclrlime and
oil of vitriol both exercise a powerful corrosive action on animal and
vegetable substances, and both become violently hot by their combination
with water. They are, therefore, set down in vulgar parlance as sub·
stances ofa hot nature; whereas, in their relations to the physical cause of
heat, they agree with the generality of bodies similarly constituted!

³⁶ There is no ground, l believe, for this assertion. The idea may have
been suggested by the elfects of quiet-lime, which was frequently strewn
on corpses in time of plague, in hastening decomposition‚ not only at the
time of being strewn but subsequently.

⁸⁰ This, as lllr. Ellis says, is true of eremacausis rather than of real
putrefaction. F or instances of the development of beat in the former
process, see lust. 23 of the last Aphorism and the note upon it.

⁸⁷ Bacon regarded putrefaction as a co·ordinate cause of generation
with copulation. See Sylva sylvarum, Experiment 900.
