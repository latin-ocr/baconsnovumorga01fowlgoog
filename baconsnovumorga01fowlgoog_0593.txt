Bacon's account of this tree is remarkably modest, as compared riti
that which Cardan reports. He says: ‘Circa arborem singulo mane densa
nebula colligitur, quae in aquam versa non solum hominibus, sed et ju·
mentis et pecoribus satisfacit!

The story may have originated in the observation oi some plant which
caudes molsture. Such piants are not uncomrnorr, as, for instance, the
Piteher Plant, some oi the Musas, the Drosera, next mentioned, dre. Or
the plant may have been one on which dew is easily deposited and re·
tained. Or, iastly, the cause might be the constant exudations oi small
inserts. Mr. Andrew Johnson, who adopts this view, quotes Livingstone's
Travels in South Africa, p. 415: ‘i had an opportunity oi obserrinya
curious insect which inhabits trees os the fig family (ficus). Seven or eight

⁵ oi them cluster round a spot on one of the smailer branches, and there

keep up a constant distillation oi a clear iiuid, which dropping to thr
ground forms a little puddie below. il a vessei is placed under themu
the evening, it contains four or tire pints oi iiuid in the morning.¹
Mr. Johnson adds: ‘A careless observer might easily suppose this liuid
to be the productiori oi the tree itseli.’

Lasalie has a long note on this passage. He quotes, in support oi the
story oi the cloud banging over the tree, an English navigator, one Robert
Lade, and supplements the evidence by an observation of his own, in which
he saw detached masses oi sog clinging to the tops of trees. But Cardan's
story seems to impiy more than this rationalistic explanation oi it.

¹² The Drosera (δροσερά) or sun-Dew. The gianrb of the leaves ernde
drops oi a clear glutinous fluid, glittering like derv-draps, whence the
name.

Mr. Ellis says: ‘i have not been ableto find this in Paracelsus. it
seems, however, to accord with his theory oi dew,—nameiy, that it is an
exudation from the sun andstars3 the suppression of which would lead to
the iomaation oi additional suns'

¹⁸ The honey-dew on tire oah, lime, rose-trec, pium-tree, &c.,is in ai
probability due toa sugary exudation from the Apbis. For a description
