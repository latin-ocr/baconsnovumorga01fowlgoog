admit the greatest reform in scientifi'c conceptions which had been
proposed for many‘generations, and which had already been before
the world for eighty years. To say nothing of Copernicans before
Copemicus²¹, the views of Kopemik himself were first published in a
letter by Rheticus in 1540, though his great work ‘De Revolutionibus
orbium coelestium’ did not see the light till the very day of his death,
hlay 24, 1543⁷². The precise thesis maintained, it must be re-
collected, was that ff the sun be regarded as the immovable centre of
the universe (we now, of course, know that it is not), and the earth
be supposed to have both a diurnal and an orbital motion, the
apparent phenomena of the heavens admit of a far more simple
mathematt'cal explanation than on the received or Ptolemaic system ⁷³.
Whether this hypothesis represents what really does take place, that
is, whether the mathematical theory is also the true physr'cal theory,
was another question, which might be resolved differently, or left
unresolved, by those who maintained the former. As Professor De
Morgan says ⁷⁴, ‘the question whether Copemicus himself was a
Copernican in the modern sense of the word is not easily settled.
His phraseology is almost always that of a mathematical Copernican.
ln a very few places, and cautiously, he leans to the physical truth
as probable, and to the diurnal motion as more probable than the
orbital' It was not till the discovery of the satellites of Jupiter by
Galileo in 1609, that the Copemican system could be said to be
