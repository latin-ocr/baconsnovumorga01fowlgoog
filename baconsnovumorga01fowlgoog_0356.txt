not hitherto been amenable, and is never likely to be amenable, to rules.
But, at the same time, as we have seen in a note on a previous aphorism
(Aph. ιη), hythe cultivation oi logical habits oi mind, 'and the habitual
observation of certain rules, even the imagination may be diverted from
improper, and directed into proper channels. Moreover, when imagina-
tion has played its part, its products must be submitted to and tested by
reason, and here it becomes necessary to employ the rules of logie, whether
such rules be stated formally, or, as is more frequently the case, applied
uneonsciously. At this point, then, arises the question (suggested by this
and the latter part ol the ra7th Aphorism, q. w), whether there is any
advance in the analyses and rules of logie in any way corresponding to the
advance which is constantly taking place in the individual sciences? On
the whole, 1 think, it may be answered that there is. For what is Logic
but the analysis oi the most correct modes of reasoning in each department
oi human thought, and the construction oi rules based on such analysis?
Now reasoning is constantly being applied to new subjecte or to new
branches of old subjects; complicated cases of reasoning, too, are con·
stantly being unravelled and referred to simple principles. Hence, though
we are never likely to discover any new laws oi thought or to add to the
simple formulae to which all reasoning may be reduced in the last resort,
yet we may be constantly gaining a wider knowledge of the applications‚
and possibly of the necessary modificatione, of our mles, increased practical
skill in weighing arguments and detecting fallacies, and a juster view of the
special characteristics which distinguish the reasoning and method of each
particular science. And that logie (in the largest sense ol the term) has, as
a matter of fact, advanced, as the particular arts and sciences have ad·
vanced‚ though not, perhaps, always in the same proportion, hardly admits,
1 conceive, oi any doubt.

The dependence of Logic on the condition oi the several seieuces is put
in a striking, though undoubtedly an exaggerated, form by Condillac (His-
toire Moderne, livre xx. ch. 12): ‘Je n’ai pas le courage de vous parler de
ceux qui, avant le reneuvellemeut des sciences, ont tente d'enseigner l'art
de raisonner. sides Tartares voulaient faire une poetique, vous penscz

bien qu’elle serait mauvaise, parce qu’ils n’ont pas de bons poetes. ll en
est de meme des logiques qui ont ete faites avant le dix-septieme siecle!
