234 NOVUM ORGANUM.

ut linea recta fiat, aut circulus perlectus describatur, multum
est in constantia et exercitatione manus, si fiat ex vi manus
propria, sin autem adhibeatur regula, aut circinus, parum aut
nihil; omnino similis est nostra ratio. Licet autem conluta·
tionum particularium nullus sit usus; de sectis tamen et
generibus hujusmodi theoriamm nonnihil dicendum est3
atque etiam paulo post de signis exterioribus quod se male
habeant3 et postremo de causis tantae infelicitatis et tam
diuturni et generalis in errore consensus; ut ad vera minus
difficilis sit aditus, et intellectus humanus volentius expurgetur
et zitola dimittat.

Idola theatri, sive theoriamm, multa sunt, et multo plura
esse possunt, et aliquando sortasse erunt. Nisi enim per
multa jam saecula hominum ingenia circa religionem et
theologiam occupata fuissent; atque etiam politiae civiles
(praesertim monarchiaelab istiusmodi novitatibus, etiam in con-
templationibus, essent aversae; ut cum periculo et detrimento
fortunarum suarum in illas homines incumbant, non solum

praemio destituti, sed etiam contemptui ct invidiae expositi ;
complures aliae proculdubio philosophiamm et theoriarum
sectae, similes illis, quae magna varietate olim apud Graecos

Burlre. That Bacon was altogether mistaten as to this point will now
hardly be disputed. His philosophy has llourished during two hundred
years, and has produced none of this levelling. The interval between a
man ol talents and a dunce is as wide as ever; and is never more clearly
discernible than when they engage in researches which require tbe constant
use of induction!

Bacon’s promise never has been, and never can be fulfilled. ln the
lnductive scientes, there is the same scope ior the play of the Imagination,
for the work of the creative and inventive faculty, as in Art or Poetry;
and there is at least as much occasion for acuteness and rapidity of
reasoning as in what are called the exact sciences. The greatest dis-
coveries in science have always been made by men witha keen perception ot
the analogies ol nature, and, consequently, with an aptitude ior framing bold,
and, at the same time, just hypotheses. The study of scientificmethod may,
and, l believe, does, strengthen and cultivate a man’s original powers,
but it can never create them or supply their place. lt must not be
lorgotten, however, that, in the work of science, even the humblest
intellect can do good service in the way of collecting and arranging materials
sor subsequent investigation.

1 shall recur to this topic in a note on the parallel passage in npn. raa.
