rra. rr. 35· 451

At instantia foederis est cometa aliquis humili0r; qui cum
sit longe infra coelum, tamen rotat⁵1. Atque commentum
Aristotelis⁵² de alligatione sive sequacitate cometae ad astrum
aliquod jampridem explosum est; non tantum quia ratio
ejus non est probabilis, sed propter experientiam manifestam
discursus et irregularis motus cometarum per varia loca coeli.

At rursus alia instantia foederis circa hoc subjectum est
motus a'e'ris3 qui intra tropicos (ubi circuli rotationis sunt

other parts ot the doctrine occur or are implied in the same chapter: cp.
also Phys. viii. 9 (2⁶5 a, b).

lt is not quite plain from Bacon’s words at the end of the paragraph,
whether he implicitly accepted this account, or not. From Aph. 48,
‘Motus decimus septimus‚' it would seem as it he did do so, whereas, in
the Descriptio Globi Intellectualis (E. and 8., vol. iii. pp. 754-5), he
calls in question the dogmas of both the circular and the eternal motion
of the beavenly bodies (cp, with regard to the former, Nov. Org. i· 45).
This treatise must have been written about 1612, so that, unless we suppose
, that, in the two passages of the Novum Organum, he is merely stating the
commonly received opinion, without thinking it necessary to criticise it,
we must admit some inconsistency in bis treatment ol this subject.

The establishment of the true nature and laws of motion belongs to the
period subsequent to Bacon‚ beginning with the discoveries ot Galileo and
ending with those of Newton. See Whewell’s History of the lnductive
Sciences.

⁵¹ The comets being as much ‘heavenly bodies' as the planets, this
instance has, of course, no signiticance lor us.

There is another respect, however, as Mr. Kitchin observes, in which
comets afford a good example oi an Instantia F oederis. Notwithstanding
the apparent irregularity of their orbits, they illustrate the Law of Gravity
equally with the planets, whose orbits are apparently regular, and hence
their motions contribute to establish the universality of that Lavv.

⁸² See Meteorologica, i. 7 (p. 344). lt is not, however, with regard to
all comets that Aristotle propounds this theory. Ὀταν μὲν οὖν ἐν αὐτῷ τῷ
κάτω τόπῳ ή ἀρχή τής συστάσεως ἦ, καθ ἑαυτὸν φαίνεται κομήτης* ὅτανδ’ ὑπὸ
τῶν ἄστρων τινός, ή τῶν ἀπλανῶν ly τῶν πλανήτων, ὑπὸ τής κινήσεως συνιστῆται
ή ἀναθυμίασις, τότε κομήτης γίγνεται τούτων τις· ού γὰρ πρὸς αὐτοῖς ήκόμη
γίγνεται τοῖς ἄστροις, ἄλλ’ ὥσπερ ul ἄλῳ περὶ τὸν ἥλιον φαίνονται καλ τήν
σελήνην πορπκολουθοῦσοι, καίπερ μεθισταμένων τῶν ἄστρων, ὅταν οὕτως ᾖ
πεπυκνωμένος ὁ ἄήρ ὥστε τοῦτο γίγνεσθαι τὸ πάθος ὑπὸ τήν τοῦ ήλίου πορείαν,
οὕτω καὶ ή κόμη τοῖς ἄστροις οἶον ἅλως ἐστίν. Πλήν ή μὲν γίγνεται δι’ ἄνάκλιισιν
τοιαύτη τήν χρόαν, ε’κεῖδ’ ἐπ’ αὐτῶντὸ χρῶμα φαινόμενόν ε’στιν. Ὀτον μὲν οὖν
κατ’ ἄστε’ρο γίνηται ή τοιαύτη σύγκρισις, τήν ούτήν ἀνάγκη φαίνεσθαι φορὰν
κινούμενον τὸν κομήτην ήνπερ φέρεται ὅ ἀστήρ· ὅταν δι’ συστῇ καθ’ ωύτόν, τότε
ὑπολειπόμενοι φαίνονται. (ρ. 34⁴³· 33-b. τι.) On Aristotle¹s theory of
comets generally, as well as the opinions oi previous philosophers, see
Meteorol. i. 6, 7.
