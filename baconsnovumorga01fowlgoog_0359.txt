SUMMARY OF BOOK ll.

Fnou the prefatory remarks of Book l, Bacon passes in Boolr ll to a
more formal and positive exposition ol his method. The first ten Aphor-
isms consist mainly of general reflections‚ for the most part very obscurely
worded, on the ends of seleuce, on the necessity of enquiring into Forms, and
on the connection between the speculative and practical branches of know·
ledge. He then proceeds to give a specimen of the investigation ofa Form,
taking as his example the Form of Heat. The first step in the investi·
gation is to draw up certain Tables, the ultimate purpose of which is
to enable him to eliminate those qualities which might be supposed to
be, but which are not really, of the required F orm. When the Tables
are completed, and the false explanations have, so far as possible, been
rejected, he proceeds, according to his own metaphor, to reap the ‘Vin-
demiatio Prima de forma Calidi: and, in order to reap this vintage, he
gives free play to the Imagination, that is, in spite oi his warnings to
the contrary in Boolr l, he frames Hypotheses. This process is called
‘permissio intellectus! ‘Atque haec sit prima vindemiatio, sive inter-
pretatio inchoata de forma Calidi, facta per permimionem intellectus'
(see Aph. πο). ln Aph. 21 he announces that, having completed the
‘Tabulae' and ‘vindemiatio Prima,’ he will proceed ‘ad reliqua auxilia
intellectus circa interpretationem Naturae et Inductionem veram ac per·
fectam' Oi these ‘auxilia’ he enumeratas nine (Aph. aa), but of the
nine one only, the ‘Praerogativae Instantiarum' (of which there are
twenty-seven varieties)‚ are discussed in the Fragment of the Novum
Organum which Bacon published. He ison the point of passing on to
the ‘adminicula inductionis,' when the work abruptly ends.
