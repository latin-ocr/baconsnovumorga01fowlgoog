Larem autem Procesrus³⁷‚ de quo loquimur, longe alia res
est quam animis hominum (qualiter nunc obsidentur) facile
possit occurrere. Neque enim intelligimus mensuras quasdam,
aut signa, aut scalas processus in corporibus spectabiles3 sed
plane processum continuatum, qui maxima ex parte sensum
fugit.

Exempli gratia3 in omni generatione et transformatione
corporum, inquirendum quid deperdatur et evolet, quid maneat,
quid accedat; quid dilatetur, quid contrahatur3 quid uniatur,
quid separetur3 quid continuetur, quid abscindatur3 quid im·
pellat, quid impediat3 quid dominetur, quid succumbat; et
alia complura.

Neque hic rursus, haec tantum in generatione aut transfor·
matione corporum quaerenda sunt, sed et in omnibus aliis
alterationibus et motibus similiter inquirendum quid antece-
dat, quid succedat, quid sit incitatius, quid remissius; quid
motum praebeat, quid regat3 et hujusmodi. Ista vero omnia

scientiis (quae nunc pinguissima Minerva et prorsus inhabili
contexuntur) incognita sunt et intacta. Cum enirn omnis actio
naturalis per minima ³⁸ transigatur, aut saltem per illa quae

³⁷ See Playfair’s Preliminary Dissertation to the Encyclopaedia Bri-
tannica, Remarks on the Novum organum: ‘Latent Process is the secret
and invisible progress by which sensible changes are brought about, and
seems, in Bacou’s acceptation, to involve the principle, since called the law
efrontinm'ty, according to which, no change, however small, can be effected
but in time. To know the relation between the time and the change
eflected in it, would be to have a perfect knowledge cl the latent process.
ln the firing of a cannon, for example, the succession of events during the
short interval between the applicatiou of the match aud the expulsiou oi
the ball, constitutes a latent process oia very remarkable aud complicated
nature, which, however, we can now trace with some degree of accuracy.
ln mechanical operatione, we can often follow this process still more
completely. When motion is communicated from any body to another,
it is distributed through all the parts of that other, by a law quite beyond
the reach of sense to perceive directly, but yet subject to investigation, aud
determined by a principle which, though late in being discovered, is now
generally recognised. The applications ol this mechanical principle are
perhaps the instances in which a latent, and, indeed, a very recondite pro·
cess, has been most completely analysed.'
