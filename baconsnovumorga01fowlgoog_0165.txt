ce qui etablit une difference' tte. (Prstace du Traducteur, p. xxv.)
‘Apres de telles preuves, il est donc permis de dire maintenant que le
rdle de Bacon, dans l'histoire des sciences d'observation, lut a peu
pros celui de Julien l’Apostat dans l'histoire du christianismo, etque la
seule place vraiment saillante qu'il occupem dorenevant dans les
sastes du passe est celle du plus hardi et surtout du plus heureux des
mystificateurs connus; a ce titre il brillera, en les effacant, au·dessus
du comte de Saint-Germain et de Cagliostr0.' (Id. p. xxiii.)

These various accusations against Bacon or his philosophy, when
we state them in brief, resolve themselves into the following: rst, he
was an atheist; and, he was a plagiarist; 3rd, he was a smatterer;
nh, his works have had no influence in the subsequent progress
os science ; 5th, his proposed methods ol investigation are defective,
il not salse, in statement, and inapplicable in practice. As these
different charges are discussed‚ and my own opinion on them stated,
in other parts of the Introduction, it is unnecessary that I should say
anything further on them in this place.
