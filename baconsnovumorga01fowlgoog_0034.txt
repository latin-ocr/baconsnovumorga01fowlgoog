remarks on Liebig, under the section headed ‘Opponents of Bacon,'

Appended to the Sylva Sylvarum in Rawley's Edition is the
New Atlantis, a work also then for the first time published. This is
deservedly one of the most populat of Bacon's wotks; it bears the
stamp of his genius as much, perhaps, as anything which he wrote;
and, lastly, it is credited, and I conceive justly s0, with having, toa
large extent, suggested the foundation and programme of our own
Royal society, if not those of several foreign scientihc associatione as
well. Its relation to the Sylva Sylvarum cannot be better described
than in the language of Mt. Spedding :-‘ The New Atlantis seems to
have been written in 1624, and, though not finisbed‚ to have been
intended for publication as it stands. It was published accordingly
by Dr. Rawley in 1627, at the end of the volume containing the
Sylva Sylvarum; for which place Bacon had himself designed it, the
subjeets of the two being so near akin; the one representing his idea
of what should be the end of the work which in the other he sup·
posed himself to be beginning. For the story of Solomon's House is
nothing more than a vision of the practical results which he antici-
pated from the study of natural history diligently and systematically
carried on through successive generations ¹⁴.'

Amongst the ‘impetus Philosophici' which occupy the latter part
of Gruter's volume are two small pleces entitled Scala Intellectus
sive Filum Labyrinthi and Prodromi sive Anticipationes Philoso-
phiae Secundae. These were intended as Prefaces to the fourth and
fifth parts of the Instauratio respectively. Whether anything more
relating to these parts is extant seems open to doubt. Possibly the
Inquisitio Legitima de Motu sive Filum Labyrinthi may be an
‘exemplar' belonging to the fourth part, but ΜΓ. Spedding inclines to
think that it was designed originally as the example of method for the
second part of the Instauration, and subsequently abandoned for the
inquisitio de Forma Calidi. As respects the fifth part, however,
Mt. Spedding seems disposed to admit to a place among the Pro·
dromi the treatisea entitled De Fluxu et Refluxu Maris, De Prin-
cipiis atque Originibus, Cogitationes de Natura Rerum, and Thema
Coeli, of which last we have already spoken in connection with the
Descriptio Globi Intellectualis.

To the sixth part of the Great Instauration, namely Philosophia
Secunda, sive Scientia Aetiva, which, in its full extent, was to be the
