in a passage which is well worthy ol the student’s attention. He
then continues: ‘Neque haec eo dicimus quod Causae illae Finales
verae non sint, et inquisitione admodum dignae, in speculationibus
Metaphysicae; sed quia, dum in Physicarum Causarum possessiones
excurrunt et irruunt, misere eam provinciam depopulantur et vastant.
Alioquin, si modo intra terminos suos coerceantur, magnopere hal·
lucinantur quicunque eas Physicis Causis adversari aut repugnare
putent! '¹ '¹‘ * * * ‘Neque vero ista res in dubium vocat Providen-
tiam Divinam, aut ei quicquam derogat, sed potius eandem miris
modis confirmat et evehit! * * * * * ‘Adeo ut tanturn absit ut
Causae Physicae homines a Deo et Providentia abducant, ut contra
potius philosophi illi qui in iisdem eruendis occupati suerunt, nullum
exitum rei reperiant nisi postremo ad Deum et Providentiam conlu-
giant! To these quotations may be added some os the passages quoted
or referred to in the section an Bacon’s Religious Opinions, especially
those in the Essay on Atheism and in the De ungnentis, iii. a.

The student who has carefully considered these passages will,
1 think, be able to form a just estimate of the extent to which Bacon
did and the extent to which he did not intend to reject the study os
Final Causes srom philosophy. He spolie, 1 believe, quite seriously,
and not with the slightest intention os employing banter, when he
compared the enquiry into Final Causea with a virgin consecrated to
uode. We may, he conceived, legitimately contemplate the ends
and objects os the various parts of nature, their relations to one
another, and the harmony ol the whole, and so rise to some con·
ception, however saint, oi the power and wisdom oi Him who framed
the Universe. ‘Quod sit Deus, quod rerum habenas tractet, quod
summe potens, quod sapiens et praescius, quod bonus, ⁸ * * **

⁴³ ‘Nam Causarum F inalium inquisitio sterilis est, et tanquam virgo Deo conse
crata nihil pauit) De Augm. iii. 5. ‘Nihil parit,' as Mr. Ellis observes in his
note on the passage, simply means ‘non parit opera.’ This will be plain to any
one who will consult the context. Bacon is speaking ol the divisions oi the ⁶ Doc-
trina Operativa? The enquiry into Efficient and Material Causcs produces
Mechanics3 that into Formal Causes produces Magic; that into Final Causea
‘nihil anit!

Dugiild Stewart (Elements, Ed. Hamilton, Worlrs vol. iii.) says that this epi·
grammatic maxim has been, perhaps, ostener quoted, particularly by Frcnch
writers, than any other sentence in Bacon's works ; these quotations, he adds,have
generally been made without any reference to the context, and, consequently, with
considerable misunderstanding ol Bacon's meaning.
