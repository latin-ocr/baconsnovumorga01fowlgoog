them are, the beginnings oi much oi the later English psychology
which became so famous in the hands oi Locha, Hume, Reid, and
others. Besides the points already noticed 1 might also draw attention
to the conception that Logic, Ethics, and Politice ought to be treated
inductively⁸, the striking contribution zonarae theory oi illemory
and Association which occurs in Novum Organum, iigo, and, above
all, the invaluable Aphorisms in the first book oi the hlovum Organum
on the idola Tribus and the Idola Specus ⁸⁴.

Bacon's Mora'l Philosophy is mainly contained in the seventh book
ol the De Augmentia and hae, perhaps, hardly received the attention
which it deserves. As Logic treats ol the intellect, Etbics treats oi
the Willil. ‘Voluntatem gubernat recta ratio, seducit bonum apparens.
Voluntatis stimuli allectus; ministri, organa et motus voluntarii!
Ethics may be divided into two principal doctrines, one treating oi
the exemplar or image ol good, the other (to which he gives the
iancilul title of ‘Georgica Animi ’) ol the regulation and culture oi
the mind. He finds fault with previous philosophers sor not having
carried their enquiries deeper‚ by searching ior⁸ the roots ol good and
evil, and the very libres oi those roots; ‘Ante omnia, si Naturam
Rerum non minus quarn Axiomata illocalia consuluissent, doctrinas
suas minus prolixas, magis autem profundas reddidissent ³⁶! Good is
either public or private, and the appetite to these two kinds ol good is
native to the human mind, and, indeed, to everything which existe.
‘inditus astatque impressus unicuique rei appetitus ad duplicem
Naturam Boni: alteram, qua res Totum quiddam est in seipsa;
alteram, qua est Pars Totius alicujus lllajoris. Atque posterior haec
illa altera dignior estet potentior ; cum tendat ad conservationem
Formae Amplioris. Nominetur prima Bonum Indrbriiuale sive Sanctia·
posterior Bonum Cartimandua! Those who are at all acquainted with

³¹ On the connection between the mind and body. and the localisation ol various
moral qualities and intellectuat iaculties, sce a curious passage in De Augmentis‚
iv. 1, especially towards the end.

³⁵ ln De Augmentis, vi. 3 (E. and S.. rol. i. p. 671), there is a good statement
oi the respective ends ol Logic and Ethics ·F inis enim Dialecticac est dooere
formam argumentorum. ad praesidia intellectus, non ad insidias. Finis itidem
Ethicae allectus ita componere, ut rationi militent. non autem eam invadant!

³⁶ At the same time, he nowhere expressly discusses the fundamental questions
oi Morals. such as the grounds ol Moral Obligation or the nature ol the Moral
Faculty, unless, indeed, we make an exception in favour oi the lew words devoted
to the ‘internus instinctus: referred to just above.
