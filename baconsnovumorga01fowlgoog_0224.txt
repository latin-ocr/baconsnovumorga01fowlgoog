constituta ad inventionem novorum operum valeant3 quia
subtilitas naturae subtilitatem argumentandi multis partibus
superat. Sed axiomata, a particularibus rite et ordine ab·
stracta, nova particularia rursus facile indicant et designant ³⁰3
itaque scientias reddunt activas.

XXV.

Axiomata, quae in usu sunt, ex tenui et manipulari expe-
rientia, et paucis particularibus, quae ut plurimum occurrunt,
fluxere3 et sunt fere ad mensnram eorum facta et extensa:
ut nil mirum sit, si ad nova particularia non ducant ³¹. Quod
si forte instantia³² aliqua, non prins animadversa aut cognita,
se offerat, axioma distinctione aliqua frivola salvatur⁸³, ubi
emendari ipsum verius foret.

⁸⁰ Except for the implied limitation to opera, this is the true conception
of the relations of the Inductive and Deductive methods. When the
axioms have been constituted by induction, they should be developed
deductiyely into all their consequences and then ultimately, if they admit
of it, applied to practice. The science of Mechanics afiords an excellent
instance of a seleuce thus constituted, developed, and applied.

The word ‘abstracta' as the equivalent of ‘inserted by induction’ is
worthy of notice. The qualities in which a number of individual objects
agree are regarded as ‘drawn from’ them, to the exclusion of those in
which they differ, and, therefore, as predicable in an axiom or proposi·
tion of the class as a whole. Properly speaking, however, the word
‘abstraced' ought to be applied, not to the qualities on which the attention
is concentrated, but to those which are withdrawn from consideration.
Attention and Abstractlon are processes the reverse of and complementary
to each other.

³¹ The existing Axioms are founded on a small number of instances,
of common occurrence, and just lit those instances, but are employed as if
they were universally true, other instances to the contrary either not being
taken into account or being explained away by sorae frivolous distinction.
ln other words, an empirical law is employed as if it were a law of causa·
tion. The student should read, in illustr-atlon of this Aphorism, Mr. Mill’s
chapter on Empirical Laws. See Mill’s Logic, bk. iii. ch. 16.

³¹ M. Bouillet draws attention to the fact that ‘instantia' is never used
in this sense in Classical Latin. But 1 think he is wrong in saying that it
issimply the English word ‘ instance' ( =example) latinised. Instantia (as
a translation of ἔνστασις) was a technical term of the schools, and, from
the meaning of an ‘objection,’ which was generally founded on a single
case, would easily pass into that which it usually bears in Bacon and in
modern works generally. In this Aphorism, it seems to have the meaning
of ἔνστασις or objection.
