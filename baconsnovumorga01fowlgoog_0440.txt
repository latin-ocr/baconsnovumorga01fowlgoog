pellare consuevimus. Eae sunt veluti oppositae instantiis
ostensivis. Exhibent enirn naturam inquisitam in infima vir-
tute, et tanquam in incunabulis et rudimentis suis ; tentantem
et tanquam primo experientem, sed sub contraria natura
latentem et subactam. Sunt autem hujusmodi instantiae

· magni omnino momenti ad inveniendas formas; quia sicut

ostensivas ducunt facile ad differentias, ita clandestinae ducunt
optime ad genera ⁵⁸3 id est, ad naturas illas communes
quarum naturae inquisitae nihil aliud sunt quam limitationes.

Exempli gratia3 sit natura inquisita Consistens, sive se
determinans3 cujus contrarium est Liquidum, sive fluens ⁵⁹.
instantiae clandestinae sunt illae quae exhibent gradum non·
nullum debilem et infimum consistentis ln fluid03 veluti bulla
aquae, quae est tanquam pellicula quaedam consistens et
determinata, facta ex corpore aquae. Similiter stillicidia,
quae, si adfuerit aqua quae succedat, producunt se in filum
admodum tenue, ne discontinuetur aqua3 at si non detur
talis copia aquae quae succedere possit, cadit aqua in guttis
rotundis, quae est figura quae optime aquam sustinet contra
discontinuationem ⁶⁰. At in ipso temporis articulo, cum desinit

the same cause. An effect of the opposite lrind takes place when a glass
vessel is filled with mercury! Playfair's Preliminary Dissertation.

1 confess that, in the former quotation, 1 do not quite understand what
Sir John Herschel means by saying that ‘its'reference to the class ol
clandestine instances does not at all assist in bringing iorward and
maturing the final results.¹ The mere act of calling it a ‘clandestine
instance‚’ of course, does not3 but, surely, the fact of noticing the cir-
cumstance of cohesion in this extreme case must have contributed largely
to forming just notions of the nature and extent ol the property.

⁸⁸ These instances, being on the extreme border¹ serve to determine the
range ol the genus, as the ‘glaring instances‚’ exhibiting a property in its
most striking form, serve to direct attention to the most characteristic
features ol the phenomenon, or, in other words, its differentiae.

⁰⁰ Bacon, of course, drew no distinction between the generic term
F luid, including gases, and the specific term Liquid.

⁰⁰ The spheroidal shape is due to the cohesion of the molecules of the
water. ‘ln large masses of liquids, the force of gravity overcomes that of
cohesion. Hence liquids acted upon by the former force have uo special
shape; they take that of the vessel in which they are contained. But in
smaller masses cohesion gets the upper hand, and liquids present then the
spheroidal form. This is seen in the drops of dew on the leaves of plants;
it is also seen when a liquid is placed on a solid which it does not moisten3
as, for example, mercury upon wood. The experiment may also be made
