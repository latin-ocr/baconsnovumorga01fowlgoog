‘In hac parte‚' he addsss ‘nihil egregii (ut nobis videtur) adhuc reper-
tum est! The saculties ol Memory‚ Imagination, and Reason are
made the basis ol the general divisions ol Learning into History‚
Poetry‚ and Philosophy. ‘intellectus’ or Understanding seems to be
the generic term including Memory‚ Imagination‚ and Reason¹⁶. As
distinct lrorn the ‘Doctrina de Anima' (or, as we should now say, Psy-
¹chologyl‚ there are two arts which treat ol the use and objects ol the
mental faculties. These are Logic and Ethic. ‘Logica de Intellectu
et Ratione; Ethica de Voluntate‚ Appetitw et Affectibus disserit:
altera Decreta, altera Actiones progignit’ Imagination exercises
the fonctions ol a messenger or intermediary in both departmentS,
that of Reason and that ol Will. ‘Nam Sensus idola omnigena
Phantasiae tradit, de quibus postea Ratio judicat: at Ratio vicissim
idola electa et probata Phantasiae transmittit, priusquam liat executio
decreti¹⁰.¹

It may be noticed that the sharp line ol demarcation· drawn here
and in similar passages between the offices ol the soacalled ‘laculties'
was a common feature ol the philosophy ol the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, and has only been replaced in comparativel'y
recent times by a more just appreciation of the complexity ol our
various mental operations and of the number ol elements which go
to make up some even oi those psychical acts which at first sight
appear the simplest.

Passing over the very curious remarks which B'acon makes on
‘Natural Divination' and ‘Fascination' (the two ‘appendices’ as he
calls them, to the part ‘De Facultatibus Animae ')‚ 1 may direct special
attention to the distinction which he draws between Perception and
Sense, a distinction which he notes as deficient ‘in this doctrine?
This distinction is not the same as that drawn by later philosophers
between Perception and Sensation ²⁷, but corresponds rather with that
between unconscious or reflex actions and conscious affections. As
instances ol the former, he gives the attraction ol the magnet‚- the

ol human learning have reference to the three parts ol hlan's Understanding. which
is the seat ol learning: History to his Memory‚ Poesy to his magnanon, and
Philosophy to his Reason.’ In the corresponding part os the De Augmentis (lib.
ii. cap, 1), the word ‘Understanding' is replaced by ⁸ Anima Rationalis!

π 1 confess that I cannot understand how Remusat can have been so utterly

mistalren (see p. 270, n. ι), as to suppose that Bacon uses lhesc terms in the same
sense ns Reid and Stewart.
