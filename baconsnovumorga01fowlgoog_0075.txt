the principles 01 science, and in applying reason to establish the
principles 01 religion. Far different was the procedure recommended
by Bacon both in the one case and the other. ‘Quantum vero ad
Illationes, nosse debemus, relinqui nobis usum rationis et ratiocina-
tionis (quoad mysteria) secundarium quendam et respectivum, non
primitivum et absolutum. Postquam euim Articuli et Principia
Religionis jam insedibus suis suerint locata, ita ut a rationis examine
penitus eximantur, tum demum conceditur ab illis illationes derivare
ac deducere, secundum analogiam ipsorum. In rebus quidem na·
toralibus hoc non tenet. Nam et ipsa principia examini subjiciuntur;
per Inductionem (inquam) licet minime per Syllogismum; atque eadem
illa nullam habent cum ratione repugnantiam, ut abeodem fonte tum
primae propositiones tum mediae deducantur. Aliter fit in Religione;
ubi et primae propositiones authypostatae sunt, atque per se sub·
sistentes3 et rursus non reguntur ab illa Ratione quae propositiones
consequentes deducit ²⁸? That it did not occur to Bacon to ask
on what grounds the authority 01 Scripture itseli reposed, may to
us appear strange, but this was not one 01 the questions which the
men 01 that age were in the habit 01 putting. Isee no reason ι
10 doubt that Bacon accepted the authority 01 Scripture as an ultimate
1001, though, as Ι have already intimated, he may, especially towards
the latter period 01 his life, have felt some hesitation as to the
truth or exactitude 01 some 01 11111 dogmatic inierences which had
been deduced from its language.

This sharp separation 01 Religion and Science, Faith and Reason,
exercised 0 considerable influence on Bacon's successors. Hobbes,
while he shewed no disposition to restrict scientific discussions,
relegated religion altogether to the cognisance 01 the magistrate. It
was the duty 01 the state to provide 0 religion for its subjects,
and these had nothing to do but to accept it without doubt, or,
01 least, without any expression 01 doubt. Thus, the sphere
01 religion was removed altogether 110111 the arena 01 discussion,
and we seem here to have almost a parody 01 some 01 the
principles propounded by Bacon. Pascal, though whether he was
influenced by the writings 01 Bacon or not I have 110 sufficient
grounds sor determining, attempted to make the divorse between
Faith and Reason complete, in the interests 01 Religion, as, at a
later period, Home did, or pretended to do, in the interests 01
Philosophy. Locke, though he wrote a treatise 011 the Reasonableness
01 Christianity, shews no disposiu‘on in his Essay either, 011 the one
