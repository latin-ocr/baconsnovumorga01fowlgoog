⁷¹ As, for instance, among the ‘instantiae solitariae,’ ‘instantiae osten·
sivae,' dec. ln fact, as already noticed, Bacon’s ‘instances' are, by no
means, mutually exclusive, and a ‘crucial instance ’ always falls under the
head of ‘solitary instances,' and generally under some other head as well.
Most crucial iustances, however, are specially invented lor the purpose of
enabling us ‘to decide between rival hypotheses, and hence, under whatever
other head they may fall, they are primarily crucial instances. They are
made, not found. This is what Bacon appears to mean by the next
clause.

*² For Bacon's views as to the influence of the moon on the spring and
neap tides, see my note on the following passage in Apb. 45: ‘Rursus,
si sit aliqua vis magnetica, quae operetur per consensum * * * inter
globum lunae et aquas maris (quae maxime credibilis videtur in fluxibus
et refluxibus semi-menstruis).' The semi-menstrual and semi-diurnal
phenomena of the tides were at this time frequently explained on
distinct principles.

'⁸ This view was maintained by Galileo. See Dialogi dei Massimi
Sistemi, Giornata iv. He refers the alternate ebb and flow ol the waters
to the composition os the annual and diurnal motions ol the earth. ‘lt
being therefore presupposed, that there are such contrarieties of motions in ·
the parts of the terrestrial surface‚ whilst it tumeth round upon its own
centre, it is necessary, that in eonjoyning this diurnal motion, with the
other annual, there do result an absolute motion lor the parts of the said
terrestrial superficies, one while very accelerate, and another while as slow
again. * * * * ⁴¹ ⁴¹ * We will conclude therefore, that lileasit
is true the motion of the whole globe, and of each of its parts, would
be equal aud uniforme, in case they did move with one single motion,
whether it were the meer annual, or the single diurnal revolution, so it is
requisite, that mining those two motious together, there do result thence
for the parts of the said globe irregular motions, one while accelerated‚ and
another while retarded, by means of the additions or subtractions of the
diurnal conversion from the annual circulation. So that, if it be true
(and most true it is, as experieuce proves) that the acceleration and re-
tardation of the motion of the vessel, makes water contained therein
