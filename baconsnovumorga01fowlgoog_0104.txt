read, ‘sed cum diligenti consideratione atque judici0,' and praises the
‘Ethics Politice, OEconomics‚ the Books on Animals, and Rhetorics':
‘tamen affirmamus et contendimus non multo pauciora vel salsa, vel
inutilia, vel etiam ridicula ab eodem scripta reperiri, ut in majori parte
librorum Naturalium, ac pene in totis Dialecticis, et non paucissimis
Metaphysicis.' He then applies to Aristotle’s writing the proverb:
‘Ubi bene, nihil melius; ubi male, nihil pejus ⁸²! When becomes
to detail, his criticisms of Aristotle betray the same liind ol impatience
and asperity with which we are familiar in the works of Bacon.
The following may serve as one specimen out os many: ‘Quis nisi
mente captus, hoc modo proprium assignaret? Sed Aristotelea, ut
librum magnum laceret, nihil praetermittebat, quamvis absurdum et
ridiculum ⁸⁸! At the end of the treatise⁸⁴, there is an unsparing in-
vective against Aristode, accompanied by an attach on Picus 'Miran-
dula and others lor confining their criticisms to the Commentators on
Aristotle, without having the courage to extend them to Aristotle him-
self. The chapter concludes with two warnings ‘memoriae mandanda,
et assidue diligenter cogitanda omnibus, qui recte philosophari
cupiunt, quorum unum est, Ubicunque et quotcunque Dialectici
· Metaphysicique sunt, ibidem et totidem esse capitales veritatis hosteS,
alterum veru, Quamdiu in scholis Philosophorum regnabit Aristoteles
iste Dialecticus et Metaphysicus, tamdiu in eis et falsitatem et bar-
bariem, si non linguae et oris, at certe pectoris et cordis regnaturam'

Over the remaining names on our list we must pass more lightly.
Ramus (b. 1502, or, according to another account, 1515, d. in the
Massacre of St. Bartholomew 1572) marks the climax oi the reaction
against Aristotle. He is said to have selected as the thesis sor his
Master of Arts' Degree the position that all the dogmas of Aristotle
are false: ‘Lutetiae Magisterii titulum suscepturus, problema hoc
sumpsit; quaecunque ab Aristotele dicta essent, commentitia esse⁸⁵.'
In this story, however, there is probably some exaggeration. But,
whether this be so or not, the life, lectures, and works ol Ramus
formed one long protest against the ascendency of the Aristotelian
philosophy, and especially of the Aristotelian Logic. One or two
specimens of his diatribes against Aristode, taken from the Aris·
totelicae Animadversiones, will be sufficient to give an idea of the
vehemence with which he carried on his attach:

¹² Lib. i. cap. 1, Ed. Leibnitz. pp. 5, 6.
⁸⁸ Lib. iv. cap. 1. · '⁴ Lib. iv. cap. 8.
⁸⁵ Petri Rarui vira ex J. T. F reigio descripta, appended to Milton's Logic.
