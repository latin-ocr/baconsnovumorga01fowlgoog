LlB. I. 66. 245

contemplationum compendia, in quibus acquiescit animus et ,

asolidion‘bus avertitur. At medici in secundis rerum quali-
tatibus et operationibus, attrahendi, repellendi, attenuandi,
inspissandi ⁴⁸, dilatandi, astringendi, discutiendi, maturandi, et
hujusmodi, operam praestant meliorem3 atque, nisi ex illis
duobus (quae dixi) compendiis (qualitatibus scilicet elementa·
ribus, et virtutibus specificis) illa altera (quae recte notata
sunt) corrumperent, reducendo illa ad primas qualitates
earumque mixturas subtiles et incommensurabiles, aut ea non
producendo cum majore et diligentiore observatione ad quali-
tates tertias et quartas, sed contemplationem intempestive
abrumpendo, illi multo melius profecissent. Neque hujus·
modi virtutes (non dico eaedem, sed similes) in humani
corporis medicinis tantum exquirendae sunt3 sed etiam in
caeterorum corporum naturalium mutationibus.

Sed multo adhuc majore cum malo fit, quod quiescentia
rerum principia, ex quibus ⁴⁹ ,· et non moventia, per quae res
fiunt, contemplentur et inquirant. Illa enim ad sermones,

from those manifest principles, would be a very great step in philosophy,
though the causes of those principles were not yet discovered: and there-
fore l scruple not to propose the principles of motion above-mentioned, they
being of very general extent, aud leave their causes to be found out.'

The conceptions of ‘occult properties’ and ‘specilic virtues' belong
to that stage of speculation in which men believed that the properties
of objects were distinct entities, separable, as it were, from the objects
themselves, and dwelling in them. ln a still prior stage of speculation,
these properties had been personitied and regarded as divine. See
Mommsen’s History of Rome, blr. i. ch. ra (Dicltson’s Translation, vol. i.
pp. 171-3), and Tylor’s Primitive Culture, ch. 15 (vol. ii. first ed.
pp. aso-22 3, second ed. pp. 242-246).

‘⁸ ‘lnspissandi stands over against Attenuandi3 its meaning being
“condensation.'’ lt does not occur in [classical] Latin writers.¹ (Mr.
Kitchin's note.)

⁴⁵ The third error arises from coucentrating our attention too exclu·
sively on the ‘principia ex quibus: to the neglect of the ‘principia per
quae,' that is, on the material to the neglect of the efficient cause. for
practical purposes, it is far more important to ask how a thing may be
produced, than what it is. Bacon's frequent remarks on the Latens
Schema'tismus and ou the Atomistic Philosophy shew, however, the im·
portance which he attached to the enquiry into the Materia} Causa,
and in the De Augmentis (lib. iii. cap. 4), he specifies the Material and
Efficient Causes as the appropriate objects of Physica, the Final aud
1⁷ ormal Causes being relegated to Metaphysics.
