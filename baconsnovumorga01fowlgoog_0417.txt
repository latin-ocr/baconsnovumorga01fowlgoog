394 NOVUM ORGANUM.

8. Per aurum et alia metalla ignita, quae densissimi sunt
corporis secundum totum, rejice tenuitatem.

9. Per ae'rem, qui invenitur ut plurimum frigidus, et minen
manet tenuis, rejice etiam tenuitatem.

10. Per ferrum ignitum, quod non intumescit mole⁹⁰, sed
manet intra eandem dimensionem visibilem, rejice
motum localem aut expansivum secundum totum.

11. Per dilatationem aeris in vitris calendariis et similibus,
qui movetur localiter et expansive manifest0‚ neque
tamen colligit manifestum augmentum caloris ⁹¹, rey'e'ce
etiam motum localem aut expansivum secundum totum.

12. Per facilem tepefactionem omnium corporum, absque
aliqua destructione aut alteratione notabili, reJi'ce
naturam destructivam aut inditionem violentam alicujus
naturae novae.

13. Per consensum et conformitatem operum similium quae
eduntur a calore et a frigore, rejice motum tam
expansivum quarn contractivum secundum totum.

14 Per accensionem caloris ex attritione corporum, rejice

naturam principialem⁹². Naturam principialem vo-

to raise the temperature ofa pound of water through one degree Centi-
grade, the thermal units in round numbers disengaged by a pound of
Absolute Alcohol and a pound of lron are respectively 7180 and 157⁶·
See Ganot’s Physics, Translation, 6th Ed, § 448.

⁰⁰ This statement is, of course, erroneous. But see notes ou Aph. 24.

⁹¹ The sole cause of the expansion of the air is its increase ln tempera·
ture, though, in so small a quantity of airas is contained ln a thermometer,
the increased temperature is not sensible to the touch. lt is the more
curious that Bacon should have fallen into this error, when we compare
what he says at the beginning of lnst. 38 of Aph. 13·

‘Secundum totum* here and elsewhere is, of course, opposed to ‘per par·
ticulas.’ lt is, perhaps, hardly necessary to notice the perverse interpreta-
tion of this expression by Liebig as ‘on the whole ;’ as if Bacon meant that
iu the majority of cases, but notin all, expansion enters into the ‘form of
hear! See Liebig's answer to Sigwart in the Allgemeine Zeitung (Tchihat·
chef, p. 159). What Bacon obviously refers to is the motion of the entire
body, as distinct from that of the minute particles. Cp. Aph. πο, Tertia
Differentia.

’Β Such would be the so-called substance of caloric, which was long sup·
posed to be contained in bodies, and to be the cause of heat. The exist·
ence of this supposed substance was disproved by Rumford and Davy.
