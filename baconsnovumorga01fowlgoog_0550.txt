tanquam in novam formam (ut loquuntur); nec post dila-

frigidi ad eam invitetur; quae non reditus est, sed trans·
mutatio repetita. Eodem modo et aqua, si per compressionem
arctetur, recalcitrat ⁶³3 et vult fieri qualis fuit, scilicet latior.
At si interveniat frigus intensum et continuatum, mutat se
sponte sua et libenter in condensationem glaciei; atque si
plane continuetur frigus, neca teporibus interrumpatur (ut
fit in speluncis et cavernis paulo profundioribus), vertitur in
crystallum ⁰⁴ aut materiam similem, nec unquam restituitur.

autem non continuationis simplicis et primariae, cum corpore
aliquo altero (nam ille est Motus Nexus); sed continuationis
sui, in corpore cert0. Certissimum enim est, quod corpora
omnia solutionem continuitatis exhorreant3 alia magis, alia
minus, sed omnia aliquatenus. Nam utin corporibus duris
(veluti chalybis, vitri) reluctatio contra discontinuationem est

⁸² This, which is the reading of the F irst Edition, is altered in the
Second to concupiscit, obviously the right word.

⁸³ Cp. Bacon's abortire experimeut on the leaden globe, as described in
Aph. 45.

⁶⁴ See Pliny, Nat. Hist. xxxvii. a (9), sect. a 3 (where he says ‘glaciem
esse certum est, unde nomen Graeci dedere ⁹), and Seneca, Nat. Qiaest.
iii. a 5 ad fin. Solinus (Polyhistor, cap. ¹5 ad fin.) combats this opinion.
Mr. Ellis says: ‘Though tbis account of the origin of crystals is of course
erroneum, yet there is a class of crystals which have been shown to occupy
the same volume which their water of crystallisation would occupy in the
state of ice; so that their other constituents may in some sort be said to
take up no space. This curious analogy with ice was proved by Playfair and
Joule in every considerable number of cases. See Phil. Mag. Dec. 1845!

Bacon seems to be speaking of stalactites and stalagmites as well as of
what are more commonly called crystals.

⁰⁴· This is Cohesiou, or the force which unites molecules of the same
nature. ‘The modern experiments on the strength of different substances,
by finding what weights are necessary in order to tear them asunder, are
founded on this property. These experiments have been made with bars
of wood, metuis, giam, dcc, of given dimensions, and it has been found
that the cohesive strength ofa body is in the joint proportion of its
elastlcity, and toughness‚ and the area of its sectiou! Dr. Hippus in the
Accouut of the Novum Organum in the Library of Useful Knowledge.
