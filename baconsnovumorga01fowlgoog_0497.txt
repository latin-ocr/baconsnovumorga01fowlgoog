474 NOVUM ORGANUM.

neque dubium est, quin sint aeris partes in hac re nonnullae;
sed alter motus proculdubio verus est, ut ex infinitis constat
experimentisfl. Sed inter caeteras, poterit esse circa hoc sub-
jectum instantia crucis talis3 quod lamina, aut filum ferri
paulo contumacius, vel etiam calamus sive penna in medio
divisa, adducta et curvata inter pollicem et digitum, exiliant
Manifestum enim est, hoc non posse imputari ae'ri se pone
corpus colligenti, quia fons motus est in medio laminae vel
calami, non in extremis ¹². .

ᾖ (7) Similiter sit natura inquisita motus ille rapidus et
potens Expansionis Pulveris Pyrii in flammam ¹³ 3 unde tantae
moles subvertuntur, tanta pondera emittuntur, quanta in cuni·
culis majoribus et bombardis videmus. Bivium circa hanc
naturam tale est. Aut excitatur iste motus a mero corporis

¹¹ Bacon did not see that the two cases which he had put were by
no means exhaustive. Nor had he stated the problem rightly. The

ι difficulty, as we now know, is not to account ior the continued motion

oi a projectile‚ but sor the cessation of its motion.

¹² He seems here, notwithstanding having drawn the distinction above,
to mistake the question at issue, which was not as to the origin oi the
motion ola projectile, but as to its continuance. And even ii his instance
were to the point, it would only be decisive against the one theory, not
in favour oi the other.

ln the Cogitationes De Natura Rerum, cap. 8 (E. and 8, vol. iii.
pp. 28-31), he treats this subject at greater length and adds other ex·
periments, which are, however, no more decisive than the one given here.

¹³ This question is also treated in the Cogitationes De Natura Rerum.
See cap. 9. Bacon’s solution of the difficulty by referring the explosion to
the ‘conflict of two bodies,’ and his lauguage about the ‘crude spirit which
is in nitre,’ are thoroughly characteristic both of his own chemical views
and, generally, of those of his time. Chemistry‚ we must recollect, had
hardly as yet put on a scientilic form, and, moreover, it was peculiarly
encumbered by the use of a fanciful and metaphorical language.

As to the true explanation of the great explosive power of gunpowder, it
‘is due to the sudden development of a large volume of gaseous bodies,
chieflyconsisting of nitrogen and carbonic enhydride, which, at the ordinary
temperature of the air, would occupy a space equal to about 300 times the
bulk os the powder used; but from the intense heat developed at the
moment of the explosion, the dilatlon amounts to at least 1500 times
the volume of the gunpowder employed! Miller’s Elements of Chemistry‚
Part ii. pp. 399·400· The principle of this explanation was first demon-
strated by Jean Bemoulli. See Hoefer, Histoire de la Chimie, tomeii.

pp. 264-265.
