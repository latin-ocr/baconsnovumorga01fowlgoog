At longe maximum impedimentum et aberratio intellectus
humani provenit a stupore et incompetentia et fallaciis
sensuum 81; ut ea, quae sensum feriunt, illis, quae sensum
immediate non feriunt, licet potioribus, praeponderent. Itaque
contemplatio sere desinit cum aspectu; adeo ut rerum in-
visibilium exigua aut nulla sit observatio. Itaque omnis
operatio spirituum ⁸² in corporibus tangibilibus inclusorum

⁸¹ lt is, perhaps, almost superfluous to remark that, since Bacon's time,
the ‘dulness incompetency, and deceptions' of the senses have been, to·
a great extent, remedied by the discovery of new instrumente, by methods
ol corrections, and by a more careful discriminatiou between our original
perceptione and the subsequent operations of the intellect upon them.

⁸² This idea of ‘spirits’ shut up in bodies, inanimate as well as animate,
ls ol frequent occurrence in the and Book. See, for instance, the 7th and
ioth Aphorisms, where some of the statements and speculations are very
eurious. Immediately borrowed, perhaps, from Paracelsus, or talen gene·
rally from the physical philosophy of the day, this doctrine seems to
have had apeculiar attraction ior Bacon. ‘The idea,’ says Mr. Ellis
(Preface to the Historia Vitae et Mortis, E. and S., vol. il. p. 94), ‘on
which Bacon’s theory of longevity is founded, namely, that the principle of
life resldes in a subtle fluid or spirit which penneates the tangible parts ol
the organisation ol plants and auimals, seems to be coeval with the first
origin of speculative physiology. Bacon was one of those by whom this
idea was extended from organised to inorganic bodies: in all substances,
according to him, resides a portion oi spirit which manifesta itself only in
its operations, being altogether intangible and without weight. This
doctrine appeared to him to be of most certain truth, but he has nowhere
stated the grounds of his conviction, nor even indicated the kind of
evidence by which the existence of the spiritus is to be established. ln
living bodies he1conceived that two kinds of spirits exist: a crude or

mortuary spirit, such as is present in other substances; and the animal .

or vital spirit, to which the phenomena ol lile are to be referred. To
keep this vital spirit, the wine oi lise, from oozing away, ought to be the
alm of the physician who attempts to increase the number oi our few and
evildays!

This physical, or rather metaphysical, theory oi a subtle, invisible, and
intangible fluicl or ether, permeating every material substance, whether
animate or inanimate, as well as the language in which we even still speah
oi ‘spirits of wine,’ and the lilre, may be regarded as curious survivals
of a primitive, fetlchistic era, when men literally believed that every object
around thern was animated or possessed by a soul or ‘spirit ’ similar to their
own, and that this soul or spirit was itself a material, though it might be an
invisible, substance. The student will find some most interesting and
suggestive remarks on this subject in Mr. Tylor's Primitive Cultum, vol. ii.
chs. 14, ις.
