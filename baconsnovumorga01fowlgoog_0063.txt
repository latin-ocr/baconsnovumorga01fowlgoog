in the Aditus ad Historiam Gravis et Levis (E. and S, vol. ii. p. 80),
and in the Descriptio Globi Intellectualis cap. 7 (E. and S.. vol. iii.
p. 762). ln the last passage, it is only sair to add, he resera to
Gilbert. Imay also add that in the Sylva'Sylvarum, Exp. 704,
Bacon shews a very just conception ol the nature ol gravhy, when
he says that it ‘is a mere motion ol matter, and bath no affinity with
the form or kind!

On subsidiary points connected with Astronomy,1 may adduce as
examples of Bacon's sagacity the lact that he saw that there must be
some reason why the heavens rotate from east to west, or, as we
should put it, why the earth rotates srom west to east ⁶, the idea of the
possibility ol predicting comets⁷, and his recognition ol the probable
⁴ or possible influence ol the moon on the spring and neap tides ⁸.

ln Nov. Org. ii. 46, we have the brilliant conjecture that the actual
state of the starry sky precedes by an interval of time that which is
apparent to usin other words, that light requires time sor its trans·
mission. ‘Atque hoc, cum similibus, nobis quandoque dubitationem
peperit plane monstrosam videlicet, utrum coeli sereni et stellati
facies ad idem tempus cernatur quando vere existit, an potius
aliquanto post ; et utrum non sit (quatenus ad visum coelestium)
non minus tempus verum, et tempus visum, quam locus verua, et
locus visus qui notatur ab astronomis in parallaxibus. Adeo incredi-
bile nobis videbatur, species sive radios corporum coelestium per tam
immensa spatia milliarium subito deferri posse ad visum; sed potius
debere eas in tempore aliquo notabili delabi.' Unfortunately‚ Bacon
proceeds to explain away his conjecture by arguments almost as
perverse as the thought itsell is felicitous ⁰.

upon the planels: ‘sut sol alliget astra Veneris et Mercurii, ne longius absint a cor-
pore ejus, quam ad distantiam certam?

⁵ Nov. Org. ii. 48 (14). For the generalisation, orrather approximate generaliss-
tion, ol this proposition, and the probable cause ol the phenomenon‚ see my notes
on the passage.

¹ De Augmentis, iv. 3 (E. and S.. vol. i. p. 558). ‘Praedictiones fieri possint de
Cometis futuris, qui (ut nostra sert conjectura). praenunciari possunt, et de omni
genere meteorum‚’ &c It must be confessed. however. that he then goes outo
speak of the prediction ol ware, seditione, schisms. &a Moreover‚ the same ques·
tion was discussed in the time ol Seneca, and even earlier. See Nat. Quaest, lib.
vii. capp. 3, 4, 19, 25. The last of these chapters is peculiarly interesting.

⁸ See Nou. Orgii. 45. 48 (9). ln my note on the former passage, 1 have spoken
ol Bacon's change ol opinion on this subject. On the causes ol the semi-diumal
ebb and tlow he seems to have been inclined to adopt an entirely different opinion.
