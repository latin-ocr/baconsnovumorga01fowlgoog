XXII.

Utraque via orditur a sensu et particularibus ²⁶, et acquiescit
in maxime generalibus: sed immensum quiddam discrepant3
cum altera perstringat tantum experientiam et particularia
Δ cursim3 altera in iis rite et ordine versetur: altera rursus jam
a principio constituat generalia quaedam abstracta et inu-
tilia ²⁶3 altera gradatim exsurgat ad ea quae revera naturae
sunt notioraffi.

‘irregulan’ that is acting sometimes one way, sometimes another. See
Mr. Ellis¹s note.

2⁵ That, in any case, we begin with particulars fumished by sense, he
takes for granted. Cp. Campanella, Metaphysiea, parsi. lib.i. Prooemium:
‘Principia enim artis, quae intelligimus, sive sint nomina imperfecte naturam
rei significantia, sive sint definitiones, perfecte eandem significantes, sive
propositiones universales, a sensu accepimus per inductionem, quod et
Aristoteles iu a Poster. docet, licet sui oblitus!

’θ Such as that ‘Nature does nothing in vain,' ‘ Nature abhors a vacuum,'
that each body has only oue proper motion, and the like.

⁸7 The phrase ‘naturae notiora' is a scholastic mistranslation of Aris·
totle's τῇ φύσει γνωριμώτερα, which ought to be translated ‘natura notiora 3'
τῇφῦσει or ἁπλῶς γνωριμώτερα are opposed to ἡμῖν γνωριμώτερα as the
more general to the more particular, as universals to objects of sense.
Amongst other places, see Post An. i. a (p. 71 h. 3 3-p. 7² a. 5): Πρότερα
δ’ r'ori troi γνωριμώτερα διχῶς· οὐγὰρ ταύτὸν πρότερον τῇ φύσει καὶπρὸς ἡμᾶς
πρότερον, οὐδὲ γνωριμώτερον καὶ ἡμῖν γνωριμώτερον. Λέγω δὲ πρὸς ἡμᾶς μὲν
πρότερα καὶ γνωριμώτερα τὰ ἐγγύτερον τῆς αἰσθήσεως, ἁπλῶς δὲ πρότερα troi
γνωριμώτερα τὰ πορρώτερον. Ἐστι δὲ πορρωτάτω μέν τὰ καθόλου μάλιστα,
ἐγγυτάτω δι’ τὰ καθ’ ἕκαστα· mi ἀντίκειται ταῦτ’ ἀλλήλοις. The student may
with advantage read Trendelenburg's note ou this passage. See notes to
the Elementa Logices Aristoteleae, t 19.

Naturally, or in reference to Nature, according to Aristotle's way of
thinking, the universal is prior to the individual, the cause to the effect,
the general law to the particular fact. By or in reference to us, on the
other hand, the individual is better known than the universal, the effect
than the cause, the particular fact than the general law. Nature indeed
may be regarded as ever striving to reproduce the type in the individuai‚
to represent the general law in its special manifestations, to carry out the
cause into its effects. And so, bya figure of speech, it may he said to
have a better or prior knowledge of that which, in our case, comes last,
und as the result oia variety of mental operations.

Bacon here, as elsewhere, avails himself of the Aristotelian distinction,
but seems to imply that with Aristode the τῇ φύσει γνωριμώτερα were
mere useless abstractions, while he himself probably understands by the
‘revera naturae notiora' those ultimate causes or Forms, out of which,
asa sort of alphabet, he conceived that the various bodies, forces, aud
