Scripturis sacris, philosophiam naturalem fundare conati sint; inter
viva quaerentes mortua. Tantoque magis haec vanitas inhibenda
venit, et coercenda, quia ex divinorum et humanorum malesana ad·
mistione, non solum educitur philosophia phantastica, sed etiam
religio haeretica. Itaque salutare admodum est, si mente sobria
fidei tanturn dentur quae fidei sunt! In the latter he says, speaking
of the causes of the slight progress hitherto made by men in the
’ sciences‚ ‘Neque illud praetermittendum est, quod nacta sit philo·
sophia naturalis per omnes aetates adversarium molestum et diffi-
cilem3 superstitionem nimirum, et zelum religionis caecum et immo·
deratuml And again: ‘At in hujusmodi misturis theologiae curn
philosophia, ea tantum, quae nunc in philosophia recepta sunt, com-
prehenduntur; sed nova, licet in melius mutata, tantum non summo·
ventur et exterminantur! And he sums up as follows: ‘At vere rem
reputanti, philosophia naturalis, post verbum Dei, certissima super-
stitionis medicina est; eademque probatissimum fidei alimentum.
Itaque merito religioni donatur tanquam fidissima ancilla: cum altera
voluntatem Dei, altera potestatem manifestet.¹

Now I think that these passages, and the complete separation
which he there advocates between theology and science, furnish the
best key to Bacon's religione opinions, and, at the same time, afford
an explanation of the almost constant disputes which have been
carried on nearly from his own times to ours as to what the nature of
his religious opinions really was. Itis easy to see thata man who
penned the above sentences might readily be suspected of harbouring
in his mind a still greater mistrust of theologica} conclusions than he
overtly expresses; and it is, at the same time, I think, no less easy to
see, if we know anything of the history of opinion, that the maxims
expressed might in Baeon's age, when speculations of this kind and
the comparison of conclusions arrived at in different branches of
knowledge were comparatively rare, be uttered, even by a man of the
most religious temperament, in perfect good-saith.

I am myself of opinion not only that the religious side of these
Aphorisms expresses Bacon's sincere convictions, but also that he did
not materially dissent from the religious teaching on what may be
called the fundamental doctrines of Christianity which was generally
current in his day.

ln order to arrive at an independent opinion on this point, I will
ask the reader, who is interested in the question, carefuliy to compare
the following references (which are, of course, far too long to be
extracted): Nov. Org. i. 65, 89 ; De Augmentis, lib. i. (E. and S,
